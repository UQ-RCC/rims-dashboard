Ultimately, we would like to quantify the various controls that sample habit, crystal shape and size, and mode of precipitation may play on argon retentivity in supergene and hypogene alunites and jarosites. These aims will be achieved trough a combination of mineralogical, geochronological, and mathematical studies. The mineralogical aspects will involve the investigation of the mineral chemistry and crystallography of hypogene and supergene jarosite and alunite by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and to better understand the thermal behaviour of jarosite and alunite, in-situ heating with transmission electron microscope (TEM) will be applied to measure the phase transformation temperature of jarosite and alunite under ultra-high vacuum.'},\n",

Hematite-rich IOCG systems, when compared to magnetite-rich systems, typically contain higher average copper grades and have a higher potential to preserve copper-rich (chalcocite) assemblages similar to those seen in Olympic Dam and Prominent Hill (Belperio et al., 2007). The identification of hematite alteration potentially linked to an IOCG mineralisation system in the Millungera Basin makes it an attractive exploration prospect. Thus, it is critical to determine the age of the rocks that host the hematite alteration and if the alteration is linked to an IOCG system. These factors will be investigated by: 1) dating the host rock formation through U-Pb zircon geochronology; 2) using petroscopy of the PAN001 drill core samples to confirm the observed alterations are mineralisation related; and 3) geochemically comparing the Pandora 1 samples with a similar IOCG formation to the west (in the Quamby deposit) to determine if they are related.\\n\\nAim:\\n\\nSEN images\\nMineral identifcation via XRD'},\n",

Moreover, Fe also deforms differently compared with Nb, thus understanding and careful analysis of the interface would be of paramount importance. It is also a contentious issue whether Fe provides enough compression to the MgB2 during the wire manufacturing process. Limited ductility of Fe would also raise the issue of micro and macro cracks in the barrier which would ultimately affect the performance of the wire. Formation of stacking faults in the MgB2 and voids in MgB2 filaments due to different heat treatment conditions would also need to examine.\\n\\nTo address all the above issues and understand the response of new wire architecture due to change of the barrier material, the wires will be evaluated/optimised using optical microscopy, transport measurements, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), 3D SEM (with serial sectioning using a focused ion beam (FIB)), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), 3D X-ray tomography, strain measurements and hardness testing.'},\n",

       "  'Descr': 'Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and its cascading events continue to be one of the major contributors to cardiovascular disease (CVD) associated deaths worldwide, calling for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Transplantation of cells with regenerative potential, scaffolding-based tissue engineering methods, activating in situ cells by triggering its renewing capabilities using growth factor and chemokines, and direct reprogramming of ischemic tissue to functional myocardium are some of the major approaches that have been intensively studied over the last decade to address these substantial need for alternative treatments to AMI.\\nOf the above-mentioned methodologies, using gene therapy for directly reprogramming cardiac fibroblast to functional cardiomyocytes stands out, not only because it relies on endogenous cells but also due to its potential to be a highly targeted, tissue-specific therapy. However, drawbacks like low-efficiency, long time scales and unsatisfactory maturation of the generated myocyte-like cells are currently hindering its clinical translation. These disadvantages can be linked to a variety of parameters including a poor understanding of the effect of cell phenotype and its microenvironment on reprogramming, lack of efficient, clinically translatable gene delivery vehicles among many others. \\nOn the other hand, in vivo studies involving direct cardiac reprogramming have persistently yielded better efficiency and maturation of the induced cells compared to their 2D in vitro counterparts. These outcomes signal an influence of the 3D cellular microenvironment on the reprogramming process. Such a role has been constantly overlooked to a point where there is no documented research relating the factor associated with the 3D environment and cardiac reprogramming. This knowledge gap is further hampered by the absence of easily customizable, scalable tools for transfection in 3D. Therefore, the aim of this study is twofold. One, to develop a versatile array of non-viral polymer-based vectors that deliver a range of genetic loads to 3D cell aggregates. And second, to elucidate the factors that affect reprogramming in such a 3D setting.\\nMultifunctional triblock polymers were synthesized in a one-pot fashion using reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) technique to package and deliver genetic material to cells. The polymerization route was optimized for shorter reaction times and to allow for easy tailoring of the delivery vehicle depending on the desired payload. Furthermore, AggreWellTM platforms were utilized to form 3D cellular aggregates from neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts (NRCFs). Future work will include further optimization of the polymer system in regards to its capability to bind and successfully deliver a range of genetic materials with high cell viability in a targeted manner. Also, transfection and the subsequent characterization protocols for 3D aggregates will be established. Finally, both modulated systems will be employed to decipher the effects of 3D microenvironment on cardiac reprogramming.\\n\\nImage the confirmation of my nanoparticles in aqueous solutions using TEM\\n'},\n",

Chemotherapy is typically administered by intravenous injection and infusion which often fails to deliver an effective concentration of the drug at the target site, with severe side-effects occurring due to off-target delivery (Prabhu et al., 2015).\\nOral chemotherapy has the potential to open a new treatment concept called “chemotherapy at home”. Unfortunately, most anticancer drugs are not suitable for oral delivery due to the myriad of physiological barriers as well as the physicochemical properties of the drugs (Saneja, 2014).  The aim of this project is to develop a model carrier for oral delivery of colon targeted anticancer therapeutics that incorporates drug-encapsulated nanoparticles within microcapsules suitable for oral delivery.\\nAn amphiphilic block copolymer of PEGMA-PMMA was synthesised and characterised successfully. Curcumin loaded micelles were formed having sizes of 30 and 70 nm with excellent drug encapsulation efficiency of 85.11% and 87.64%. Further, the micelles were encapsulated into an alginate microcapsule carrier to make a favourable formulation for oral delivery. In vitro release studies of the curcumin-loaded micelles showed a sustained diffusional release at pH 5.0 and 7.4.Cytotoxicity of the Curcumin loaded micelle and blank micelle were investigated. Biodistribution of microcapsules through oral delivery were investigated using small animal fluorescence imaging. \\n'},\n",

It offers a great opportunity to overcome many limitations associated with most current bio-sensing techniques, such as long surface bio-functionalization steps which can lead to irreproducible data from batch to batch. More importantly, it is particularly suited for identifying the key physicochemical changes experienced by certain biomolecules as a result of diseases. During disease progression, many biomolecules undergo massive changes in their molecular sequence, structure or conformation that impact their intrinsic physicochemical properties and/or function. This change in physicochemical properties can significantly alter their interaction behaviour towards the metal surfaces. In this way, interfacial biosensing can identify the molecular signatures of disease-associated biomolecules by comparing their metal-interaction behaviour with a normal standard.\\n\\nAIM: The aim of the project is to find the interaction of gold nanoparticles/gold surface with genomic DNA, RNA, cfDNA, and protein at the diseased conditions.'},\n",

       "  'Descr': 'Polymerisation-induced self-assembly (PISA) mediated by reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) aqueous dispersion polymerisation has been widely introduced and developed. This technique has become an attractive tool to synthesise different polymer nanoparticles of controllable size, morphology, and functionality. However, nearly all the previous PISA processes are mediated by a RAFT agent with a single active site. It remains unclear how the PISA would be proceeded if RAFT agents with multiple active sites are used, which may lead to a new understanding of PISA process and advanced nanoparticles with innovative morphologies. It is, therefore, the aim of this project is to perform and compare PISA process using RAFT agents with single and multiple active sites. To achieve this, RAFT agents with one, two, three and four active sites were prepared by reacting 4-cyano-4-[(dodecylsulfanylthiocarbonyl) sulfanyl] pentanoic acid (CDTPA) with corresponding using DCC coupling reaction.  Macro RAFT agent based on poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMA) (macro-CTA) using the obtained RAFT agents were prepared by RAFT polymerisation. Benzyl methacrylate was used to form the solvophobic block for the subsequent polymerisation-induced self-assembly in ethanol using the obtained macro RAFT agents with a different number of arms.  Finally, the morphology of different polymer nanoparticles was analysed by instruments such as dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The outcome of this project will provide new insight into how PISA and the nanoparticles thereof will be influenced by the number of active sites of the RAFT agents used.\\n\\nAIM: Use TEM to measure the controlled particle shapes.'},\n",

We first adsorb metal nanoparticles to the polymer and use them as catalytic sites for the nucleation and growth of the secondary metal, forming a complete, non-porous shell around the capsule. To date we have successfully grown gold shells using platinum nanoparticles as the catalyst, however the cost implications of using gold limits the potential applications of this technology.\\n\\nThis project will focus on exploring potential metal pairings to grow impermeable shells onto polymer microcapsules in order to allow full retention of the core oil.'},\n",

       "  'Descr': 'Decades of research has proven that only a multifaceted approaches that combine therapy and diagnosis can be used to successfully combat cancer with high precision and low side effects. In this research work, we employ a versatile nanosystem which is capable of delivering two photo-responsive drugs that act in a concerted approach. The therapeutic agents are mediated by upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) capable of transmitting low energy near infrared (NIR) light to other photoresponsive agents incorporated into a liposomal drug delivery system endowed with FA-PEG for site-specific delivery. Herein, Carbon monoxide (CO) which plays a role as a gasotransmitter with cytoprotective and homeostatic properties is employed to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) capable of inducing apoptosis. A novel amphiphilic manganese carbonyl complex (1.Mn) will be used as a carbon monoxide releasing molecule (CORM) to spatially and temporally control the CO release and activation after excitation by UCNP mediated photons. The excitation concurrently activates Indocyanine Green (ICG) which is incorporated in the hydrophobic layer for photothermal therapy. After successfully synthesizing the drug delivery system, we will determine the morphology with TEM and SEM analysis as well as the particle size and zeta potential of the final nanoparticle. We will determine the ability of the drug delivery system to mediate the sustained release of CO and ICG only after light excitation. The in vitro cellular uptake of nanoparticles will be determined with both confocal laser scanning microscopy and flow cytometry. The in vivo cellular uptake will be determined according to specific time intervals. An evaluation of the qualitative and quantitative levels of cellular ROS will be performed. The apoptotic ability of the nanoparticle will also be determined by MTT and cytotoxicity assays. The ability of ICG to generate excessive levels of heat will also be determined in vitro and in vivo. Overall, we will combine in vitro and in vivo studies to determine the efficiency of this versatile drug delivery system while we employ UCNP and ICG imaging for diagnostic purposes.\\n\\nTEM'},\n",

In recent years, combination of chemotherapy with other efficient therapies, such as photothermal and photodynamic therapies, has been populated to enhance the treatment efficiency and reduce the severe side effects. Up to now, many functional nanomaterials carrying diverse therapeutic components have been reported with a remarkable improvement in cancer treatment. With the nanotechnology advancements, more cost-effective anti-cancer therapeutic strategies have been proposed and extensively investigated, a promising one of which is nanotheranostics. Such a strategic nanosystem possesses two or more functions, such as diagnosis/imaging for cancer tissues, therapies for inhibiting cancer growth and detection for the therapeutic effect. One of these nanosystems is MgAl-layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoparticles that can be readily functionalised as theranostic agents. LDH nanoparticles have been found to be effective delivery vehicles for biomolecules (gene and siRNA), anionic anticancer drugs and anionic dyes with very good biocompatibility. The versatile composition enables LDH to be facilely doped with various metal ions. Based on these advantages my research focus is to develop transition metal-doped layered double hydroxide (M-LDH)  multifunctional nanoparticles as efficient theranostic agents.'},\n",

Thus, the two Dscam2 isoforms could function as distinct cell recognition molecules in different neurons or alternatively, each isoform could possess unique functional properties. To address this we investigated Dscam2 isoform expression in the Drosophila larva, where isoform B is exclusively expressed in motor neurons (MNs) and both isoforms are expressed in the ventral nerve cord, where MN dendrites and pre-motor interneurons reside. Larvae expressing one isoform of Dscam2 in all Dscam2-positive cells exhibited gain-of-function phenotypes consistent with inappropriate interactions between neurons that normally express different isoforms. Loss-of-function phenotypes were also observed in MNs expressing the incorrect Dscam2 isoform, suggesting distinct roles for these two proteins. Electrophysiological recordings of MN synapses revealed that larvae expressing the incorrect isoform or lacking Dscam2 entirely exhibited an increase in synaptic strength, caused predominantly by presynaptic increases to release probability at individual active release sites. These findings implicate Dscam2 directly in modulation of synapse function and therefore serve to highlight the pleiotropy exhibited by Dscam2 in neuronal development.'},\n",

       "  'Descr': 'Lemon myrtle (Backhousia citriodora) is a native Australian species whose leaves contain oil with the highest citral content ([[lt]]98%) of any known plant in the world.  Steam distillation is used to extract essential oil from the leaves and this is used in aromatherapy products, cosmetics and toiletries, and as a food flavouring.  The leaves are also dried and milled for use in teas or as a spice.  Growth of this Australian native food industry has increased substantially in recent years, in both Australian and overseas markets.  However, the introduction of the rust fungus Puccinia psidii into Australia in 2010 has jeopardized its expansion and success.  Limpinwood, the widely used commercial cultivar, is highly susceptible to P. psidii and yield losses have been estimated to be up to 70% in plantations not utilising fungicides.  Glasshouse studies and field trials in a commercial lemon myrtle plantation in New South Wales were undertaken to gain an understanding of: (1) factors influencing the susceptibility of lemon myrtle to infection by P. psidii and host colonisation; (2) the influence of climatic factors and inoculum density on the incidence and severity of P. psidii in lemon myrtle; and (3) the effect P. psidii infection has on the growth and yield of lemon myrtle, including the impact on essential oil properties.  This research will assist with the development of a forecasting system for this disease and enable more informed, effective and economically feasible management decisions to be made, particularly regarding fungicide applications.  It will also enable an evidence-based economic evaluation of the impact P. psidii is having on the commercial production of lemon myrtle.'},\n",

Only with disruption of gene expression can we get direct insight into gene function but no study so far has disrupted sponge embryogenesis. The difficulty lies in most sponges brooding their embryos but we are overcoming this problem by working with the oviparous sponge Xestospongia bergquistia, culturing its embryos in vitro, and disrupting development using pharmaceutical agents. We are focusing on the most likely candidate as the primary patterning mechanism of pre-Cambrian embryos, the canonical Wnt pathway. With this project, we expect to gain insight into the ancestral function and gene regulatory network of the Wnt pathway. More generally, our aim is to establish this sponge as a model to study gene function in sponge embryogenesis.\\n\\nAims: Description of embryological development, sectioning of in situ hybridisation material.

Overall, these findings will provide novel information on the metabolic interactions between sponges and their associated-microbes.\\n\\nWe plan to use either TEM or SEM (on sponge tissue sections embedded in resin) in order to create maps that can then be correlated with and used to interpret nanoSIMS images.

The removal of five MPs was also evaluated by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. The modified photo-Fenton process was also validated using synthetic wastewater and real secondary wastewater effluent as matrices, and results suggest the dosage should be doubled to ensure equivalent removal performance.

       "  'Descr': 'Reversible solid oxide cells (RSOCs) are the electrochemical devices that can be operated in electrolysis and fuel cell modes for generation of hydrogen/syngas and electricity, respectively. In electrolysis mode, H2O and CO2 are dissociated at the fuel electrode into H2 and CO. The waste heat from nuclear and coal power plants and electricity from renewable energy resources can be used for this purpose. In fuel cell mode, the hydrogen or syngas is delivered again to the fuel electrode where it is converted into electricity. RSOCs, therefore, can be very helpful in the development of hydrogen economy and reduce the greenhouse emissions.      \\nVarious air electrodes developed during the last two decades perform quite well during the fuel cell mode. However, different studies have confirmed their higher degradation rates during the electrolysis operation. The most severe kind of degradation observed for various electrodes is their delamination from the electrolyte, resulting in a substantial increase in ohmic and polarization losses. Improving the activity and stability of air electrodes especially during the electrolysis mode is a major challenge towards the commercialization of RSOCs. \\nThe aim of this study is the performance enhancement of previously developed air electrodes as well as the development of new materials with high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities. The study focuses on the determination and improvement of the electrocatalytic activity of different air electrodes under the fuel cell and electrolysis modes. The study also focuses on improving the stability of developed air electrodes under fuel cell and electrolysis operations. \\n'},\n",

       "  'Descr': 'Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), which operate at high temperatures (500-1000˚C), have attracted considerable attentions for its relatively high overall efficiency and wide-ranging fuel sources. Methane is the main component of natural gas which is widely available in the environment. Therefore, direct methane solid oxide fuel cells would be a competitive option for next generation power source. Ni/YSZ cermet is the most extensively used and investigated anode material. It exhibits good catalytic activities for methane reforming or direct oxidation; however, carbon accumulation on Ni surface is a disturbing problem that hinders the development of direct methane SOFCs. Therefore, this project aims to develop high performance and anti-carbon formation anode materials for direct methane SOFCs.'},\n",

       "  'Descr': 'Oxygen electrocatalysis, including the oxygen-reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen-evolution reaction (OER), is a critical process for metal–air batteries. Therefore, the development of electrocatalysts for the OER and the ORR is of essential importance. Indeed, various advanced electrocatalysts have been designed for the ORR or OER; however, the origin of the advanced activity of oxygen electrocatalysts is still somewhat controversial. The enhanced activity is usually attributed to the high surface areas, the unique facet structures, the enhanced conductivities, or even to unclear synergistic effects, but the importance of the defects, especially the intrinsic defects, is often neglected. Thus, my PhD research focuses on the controllable introduction of defects onto nonprecious metal electrocatalyst, especially the iron-cobalt oxides and the cobalt selenide, and the study of the effect of the defects on the OER/ORR performance of the catalysts. The defect–activity relationship is also explored by theoretical methods. TEM is one of the most important instruments I apply in the research, which is used to observe the microstructure of the materials, do the EDS mapping, and carry out the SAED tests.

       "  'Descr': 'Organic-inorganic lead-based hybrid perovskites with the structure of APbX3 (A= organic or inorganic cation, X= halide anions) have possessed enormous attention during the last few years as the solar-cell absorber with a sharp increase of power conversion efficiency from 4% to more than 21%. Excellent optical and electronic properties of this materials makes them the most qualified option in this area after the conventional silicon solar cells. However, lead halide two serious issue of toxicity and stability lead (Pb)  have hindered the commercialization of this class of solar cells.To address these, many researcher groups focused on developing lead-free materials. Initially, replacing lead with tin (Sn), homovalent group -14 element with similar chemical properties Pb, resulted in promising efficiency of around 6%. However, rapid oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ makes tin-based perovskites an unfeasible candidate to suppress toxicity and stability issue of the Pb-based ones. Another approach is substitution of Pb2+ with another isoelectric element like bismuth (Bi3+). However, due to the different valence state of Bi3+ from Pb2+ incorporation of Bi into the structure is accompany by a reduction in dimensionality(D) of the structure from 3 to 2 or 0D, which is less favourable in terms of photovoltaic properties of an ideal light absorber (paper 294, ref 15-18). In order to accommodate Bi3+ in perovskite structure with a 3D framework, one way is introducing another monovalent metal cation into the structure to neutralise the charges and forme a double perovskite material with the formula of A2B+Bi3+X6, named elpasolite. In this rich family with more than 350 different members, just less than 13 number of them can meet the requirements of a suitable photovoltaic absorber. However, most of the synthesised materials with this structure found to have a wide bandgap in compare to their Pb-based analogues. Among these potential candidates, Cs2AgBiBr6 seems to be the most promising choice, as many researchers focused on study the applicability of this material in photovoltaic devices and reported the band gap of around 2 eV, an acceptable theoretical charge carrier effective masses, high optical absorption coefficient, photo luminesces of 620 ns. However, just a limited number of works can be found that studied the realization of Cs2AgBiBr6 in solar cells with the best reported efficiency of 2.4 % for the device with mesoporous structure.\\n\\nXRD for analysing material crystallography.

       "  'Descr': 'Hot rolling is one of the key processes in the steel manufacutre. During the rolling, oxide scale is formed on the surface of the work piece due to the high working temperature (normally from 800 to 1250 degree C). The three-layered oxide scale (Wustite, Magnetite and Hematite in sequence) and the surface roughness after rolling play are important parameters in the hot rolling process. The oxides affect the friction between the rolls and the work piece as well as the heat transfer and consequently affect the rolling force, torque and energy consumption of the process. Surface roughness is also an important index of rolled steel quality.\\nThe lubrication applied in the hot rolling of the steels has been a long-standing research topic because it has a potential to improve both the rolls’ life and the surface quality of the steel as well as to decrease the energy consumption. Thus, the rolling force can be minimized and the rolls can be replaced less frequently. Traditional Oil-in-Water emulsions used for the hot rolling process are often prone to blockage and hence regular maintenance is required. Another problem is the oil-based lubricant produces smoke and the discharge of residual oil is of environmental concern. In order to meet today’s environmental demands, the development of an environmentally-friendly water-based lubricant with superior lubricant performance is now a trend in the field of lubrication.\\nAs part of this trend, water base lubricants have been trialled with inorganic suspensions to enhance the performance of the lubricant.  Zeolites are inorganic crystalline nanoporous aluminosilicates, and are widely used as molecular sieves and for the removal of heavy metals due to ion exchange ability. The high surface area of the zeolite structures also enables catalytic applications. Furthermore, zeolite coatings have been evaluated for application as anticorrosion coatings because their chemical and thermal stability. Recently, zeolites have been used as eco-friendly antioxidant in oil lubricants. The non-toxicity of the materials make it possible to be an alternative environment-friendly lubrication additive. \\nThis project aims to explore the potential application of zeolite use as additive in water-based lubricant for hot rolling. Explicitly, zeolites can be used as proactive agent to reduce the thickness of oxide scale by preventing/retarding oxygen penetration of the steel surface and by forming a protective layer during the rolling process. The zeolite–based coating can also potentially as a carrier medium for depositing specific elements/materials on to the work piece surface, resulting in the enhancement of the mechanical properties of steel.  \\n\\nIn this preliminary study, we aims to\\n\\n- Select suitable types of zeolites for the lubrication application\\no We will investigate the morphology and the structure of different types of zeolites by SEM first.\\no TEM may be required to investigate the porosity of a single crystal zeolite if they are synthesised at UQ.\\no X-ray diffraction may also be required to investigate the crystal structure of any zeolites synthesised at UQ (short range/long range crystallography)\\n\\n- Understand the tribological performance of zeolite on steel samples and the oxide scale.\\no SEM/EDX will be used to examine the wear tracks after the tribological tests. That includes the surface topography and the chemical composition of wear tracks on the steel samples (ALSI 1045). During the tribological test (block on ring), water –based lubricant (containing 0.1 wt% zeolite) will be applied on the contact area.  \\n'},\n",

       "  'Descr': 'Magnesium alloys containing rare earth elements, such as ZE41A‒T5, WE43B‒T6 and EV31A‒T6, are used in the production of the gearbox housing of navy helicopters due to their good high temperature mechanical properties (strength and creep resistance). \\nThe navy helicopters are routinely exposed to seawater during their normal operation, especially during take‒off and landing. The exterior of the gearbox housing is typically coated with corrosion resistant paint to provide protection against corrosion. However, overtime the coating deteriorates. Because Mg is a reactive metal and because Mg alloys have high corrosion rates, any degradation of the surface coating leads to rapid localised corrosion, which considerably increases frequency and cost of maintenance and may ultimately reduce service life of the helicopter. Therefore, control of corrosion is essential to ensure that that normal operation of the helicopters is not compromised.\\nA considerable body of research has been carried out on the corrosion behaviour of magnesium alloys in different environments including ZE41 and WE43 alloys. Various aspects of corrosion, including the influence of the metallurgical features on the corrosion behaviour have been the subject of the research. However, the influence of alloying elements (Ce, La, Nd, Gd) on the corrosion resistance of ZE41and WE43 alloys has not been studied in sufficient detail. The project seeks to build on the existing knowledge and gain further insights into the corrosion mechanisms of these alloys in NaCl solutions in the context of the influence of microstructure and alloying on corrosion. \\nThe magnesium alloy EV31 is a new alloy and very little research has been conducted to study the corrosion behaviour of the alloy. The project also seeks to understand the corrosion behaviour of EV31 in various environments.\\nIn addition to the stated aims, the project seeks to understand the scientific principles of the interaction between the corrosion inhibiting compounds (applied directly onto the surface of the alloys) and magnesium alloys in corrosive environments and the effect of different classes of CICs on the corrosion behaviour of the magnesium alloys ZE41A, WE43B and EV31. The gained knowledge will then be used to provide temporary, in situ, protection against corrosion. \\nThe project will aim to carry out a series of laboratory and field tests to measure corrosion rates of the alloys with and without CICs and compare them with those of pure magnesium. The laboratory tests will be performed in 3.5 wt% NaCl solution and by salt spraying to simulate as closely as possible the environment in which the navy helicopters operate. The field tests will be carried out near the sea in an atmosphere with high humidity.\\nIn majority of instances the corrosion rates of pure magnesium with impurity levels below the tolerance limit are lower than the magnesium alloys. However, initial studies showed that the magnesium alloy WE43B had the lowest corrosion rates among all alloys studied followed by EV31A tested in 3.5 wt % NaCl solution. This was found to be due to the positive influence of alloying elements Y, Nd and Gd to the stability of the surface films formed during immersion.\\n'},\n",

All samples are metallic alloys, very stable which have been prepared by conventional metallography techniques.\\n\\nFull abstract (including the aims of project):\\nAbrasion-resistant white cast irons are a group of the wear resistant materials on which mining and mineral processing industries rely. Their excellent abrasive wear resistance is the key factor to increase their applications in mineral handling and mineral comminution (crushing and grinding) equipment such as ball mill liners and ore chute liners in preventing premature failure of equipment. However, huge expenses are still spent on replacement of the wear consumables and consequent breakdowns. Therefore, increasing the wear life of these materials have been of high interest for researchers and industries.\\nParticle reinforced composite effect in white cast irons improves the wear resistance of theses alloys above what would be expected from the bulk hardness alone. This is due to the presence of the hard chromium or niobium carbides in a ductile metallic matrix. However, if the micro-fracture of carbides occurs, the wear performance of the material would be poorer than what would be expected from the bulk hardness. Therefore, in vast majority of industry applications, highly alloyed white cast irons give better wear life than martensitic steels, but if microfracture is the dominant wear mechanism, it has been shown that there is no significant benefit in application of highly alloyed white cast irons in comparison with martensitic steel. Hence it is substantially important to determine whether micro-fracture mechanism occurs under the working conditions. Contrary to general misconception, even in the absence of the impact forces, microfracture of carbide particles could readily occur under high normal stress abrasion condition. As strong and tough abrasive minerals are able to transfer the contact forces from the counterface to the material causing the microfracture of carbide particles, the occurrence of high stress condition is largely dependent on the mineral’s characteristics. \\nAccordingly, the main aims of this project are:\\n- Investigation of low stress sliding abrasion, high normal stress abrasion and meso-scale fracture of high chromium white cast irons with systematic variations of Cr and C levels by means of industrially realistic and statistically rich testing equipment — the generated data are to be used in simple form and/or as host alloys for addition of NbC co-reinforcing particles;\\n- Investigation of the possibility of introducing NbC to the selected high-Cr host white cast irons to improve their wear performance under various testing conditions and then quantitative evaluation of the effect of niobium volume fraction on wear resistance and fracture toughness — including finding a practical approach to add large amounts of niobium as a macro-alloying element into white cast irons;\\n- Investigation of the dominant wear and damage mechanisms in Nb-free and Nb-bearing white cast irons as well as the external conditions and microstructural features which control the occurrence of micro-fracture wear mechanisms in chromium or niobium carbide particles.'},\n",

       "  'Descr': 'In response to global warming due to excessive use of fossil fuels, there has been an increased focus on alternative green and renewable energy resources. Among the alternatives, hydrogen is a promising fuel and an energy source that can be produced by water electrolysis or from other resources such as natural gas. It is also eco-friendly because it is possible to produce energy with only water as by-product. Many efforts have been made to utilize hydrogen for both stationary and mobile applications using various types of fuel cells. However, these applications will only become feasible when efficient hydrogen storage and transport techniques are developed [8]. Due to the low boiling point and volumetric density of hydrogen, the conventional storage of hydrogen as either a gas or liquid are complicated. Thus, a new hydrogen storage system with high capacity is required. Magnesium hydride (MgH2) is an ideal material for hydrogen storage with a high gravimetric storage capacity (7.6 wt.%), low cost and good availability. However, the sluggish hydrogenation/dehydrogenation kinetics and high temperature of hydrogen release (at approximately 350°C) remain obstacles for on-board applications.\\n\\nI would like to receive training for microscopy and microanalysis equipment of CMM below.\\n(1) JEOL JSM-6610 SEM EBSD/EDS, Image J SE/BSE\\n(2) TEM F20, Hitachi HT7700 \\n'},\n",

       "  'Descr': 'Additive manufacturing (AM) is a disruptive technology ideally suited for producing high value products for niche applications. Titanium alloys are strong candidate materials for AM, and substantial progress has been made in recent times with functional titanium components being manufactured for commercial applications.\\nThe purpose of this research is to investigate new potential alloy compositions for AM. AM is a melting and solidification process and, similar to the principles of alloy design for casting and welding processes, new alloy designs for AM should contain constituents that refine the microstructure, minimize defects and improve overall mechanical properties. One of the current scientific challenges in AM of Ti-6Al-4V is to prevent columnar β-grain formation, as this can cause mechanical property anisotropy. The production of fine-grained equiaxed β-grains may be a promising solution to improve isotropy. Furthermore, since the properties of α/β titanium alloys such as Ti-6Al-4V are largely influenced by the α-phase, another opportunity during alloy design is to concurrently introduce grain-refining additives for the α-phase.\\nCarbon and boron are powerful alloying elements for titanium alloys, which are reported to refine both β-Ti and α-Ti during solidification processing. The addition of these elements for AM titanium alloys, and their effects on the microstructure and mechanical properties of the alloys will be investigated in this project.\\n\\nIt is hypothesised that grain refinements of β-Ti is due to constitutional supercooling and growth restriction due to the presence of TiC and TiB particles; while α-Ti is refined as TiC and TiB can nucleate these phases. We intend to use the FEI Scios FIB – Dual Beam SEM to prepare TEM lamellar of the titanium alloy samples with the addition of carbon and boron. Regions which contains the TiC/β-Ti, TiC/α-Ti, TiB/β-Ti and TiB/α-Ti, will be cut out for TKD observation in the Scios FIB machine. This will allow the orientation relationships between TiB and TiC with the α-Ti and β-Ti to be studied, to verify the hypotheses for the refinement mechanisms. Furthermore, the TEM lamellae will be observed under Hitachi HT7700 TEM. TEM diffraction patterns of the different phases is also a powerful tool to confirm their orientation relationships.\\n'},\n",

Sn-Cu alloys have generated interest as potential candidates for high-temperature soldering applications, as they are economically feasible [[and]] environmentally safe. However, the challenge arises from the formation of a brittle intermetallic compound (IMC), Cu3Sn produced as a result of a peritectic reaction that occurs in the Sn-Cu system. My research aims to investigate alloying elements that can potentially suppress the formation of this brittle IMC. By micro-alloying additional elements with Sn-Cu, promising results have been achieved by light microscopy.  I would like to use SEM/EDS to conduct surface analysis, microstructural morphology, as well as analyse chemical and elemental composition of these samples. I would also like to learn EBSD to learn about the crystallographic orientation and structure of my samples.'},\n",

This research will observed the influence of additional alloying element in Sn-Cu and Sn-Bi alloys in inhibiting IMCs formation during soldering and aging processes, lowers wetting time and enhances the shear strength of the joints due to the solid solution strengthening or precipitation strengthening. The interaction of the Sn-Cu-xBi and Sn-Bi-xSb with different type’s surface finish allows for further understanding of alloys’ kinetics growth.

       "  'Descr': 'Tool steels are medium to high carbon steels, which were especially designed for making cutting tools and forming dies. Cutting tools and dies normally have very complicated shapes, require high hardness and toughness and are associated small production batch. Hence, the cost of production of such tools and die in manufacturing process is very high. The development of additive manufacturing (AM) has been considered as an alternative approach to produce tools and dies with low cost. However, AM has a few characteristics that differ from the conventional manufacturing processing, which include: dynamic and small melting region, superfast heating and melting, extremely rapid cooling, significant thermal gradient, directional cooling process, complicated thermal history and high residual stress. Hence, the AM products using the currently available commercial tool steels are not as good as expected. Up to date, more and more researchers on AM have realized that new alloys especially for AM need to be developed.\\nThis project aims to develop new tool steels that can be used as feedstock in AM process through integrating the recently developed novel grain refinement technology for steels with adjustment of the chemical compositions of the commercial tool steels, such as H13 steel. The new alloys will enable to produce high quality cutting tools and/or forming dies at significantly lower costs. (Ron: See Project 332)'},\n",

       "  'Descr': 'Telomeres, the repetitive DNA-protein complexes at the ends of linear chromosomes, shorten with each cycle of DNA replication, providing a counting mechanism to limit the number of times a cell can divide. Most cancer cells have activated the ribonucleoprotein enzyme telomerase to add telomeric DNA repeats and counteract telomere shortening, allowing for unlimited proliferation. In contrast, normal cells have undetectable or low levels of telomerase. Inhibition of telomerase is a promising approach for cancer therapy that should be effective against a broad range of cancers while displaying few side effects.\\nWe reported the purification and composition of the human telomerase enzyme complex, consisting of two molecules each of: i) the telomerase reverse transcriptase catalytic protein component; ii) the telomerase RNA; and iii) the RNA-binding protein dyskerin (Cohen SB, et al. (2007) Science, 315, pp 1850-1853). Building on this knowledge we established an over-expression system in suspension HEK-293T cells that yields ~400-fold greater activity over endogenous levels, performed on the 20-Litre scale; this system is providing sufficient telomerase for cryo-electron microscopy. We are currently in the early stages of cryo-grid optimization.\\n'},\n",

Many axon degenerative assays used for SARM analysis use Drosophila or C. elegans as an animal model, which would provide more specific detail for drug design and analysis, also providing the possibility to “humanise” the catalytic pocket of the ortholog TIR domains to mimic human.\\n\\nOptimisation of crystal conditions and well diffracting crystals for X-ray crystallography studies.'},\n",

       "  'Descr': 'Voltage-gated ion channels (VGICs) are a superfamily of membrane proteins encoded by more than 143 genes in the human genome, making it one of the largest superfamilies of signal transduction proteins. These ion channels are recognised as among one of the most important, yet underutilised, drug targets. Unsurprisingly, there has been a surge of biophysical studies in the recent decades that aim to develop antagonist modulators such as peptide toxins as therapeutic agents. The sodium VGIC subtype Nav1.7 is involved in nociception, and as such is one of the most promising drug targets for inhibition.\\nStructural studies of membrane proteins are typically undertaken in detergent micelles. Due to the absence of a native lipid bilayer, this model can lead to poor in vitro stability, sample inhomogeneity and does not represent the native environment for a channel. Recently, nanodiscs (NDs) have been developed to solubilize and reconstruct membrane proteins in lipid bilayers. Nanodiscs consist of a membrane scaffold protein wrapped around a lipid bilayer, forming disc-like rafts. NDs can essentially mimic membrane environments, and be ultimately used to derive physiologically relevant functional and structural data.\\nWe are interested in the application of nanodiscs with NMR spectroscopy in a novel approach to overcome past experimental limitations and advance research on VGICs and their peptide modulators. The elucidation of peptide-channel binding, both the kinetics and structural interaction, is uncommon in VGIC research due to experimental difficulties when using detergent micelles for VGICs. With nanodiscs we can solubilize the channel quantitatively in homogenous and compact models, while also providing a native environment, for biophysical studies such as NMR. Applying these methods, we are studying the spider toxin VSTx1 and the potassium VGIC, KvAP. We will present data on the peptide’s channel specific binding affinity (Kd) and the residue-specific interactions between both.\\n\\nContacted Alan on 11.04.18 for an update on his project plans.'},\n",

In absence of SARM, the loss of the neuron upon axonal injury is inhibited. Thus, it is considered as an important drug target for the neurodegenerative disease. This protein has three functional domains namely, N-terminal ARM domain followed by a SAM domain a C-terminal TIR  domain. TIR domain is responsible for the degrading NAD+, however, for its function oligomerization by the SAM domain is critical.

       "  'Descr': 'Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are central components of host innate immunity. Upon activation, their cytosolic TIR (Toll/interleukin-1 receptor) domains recruit the TIR-domain containing adaptor proteins MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88) and MAL (MyD88 adaptor-like protein) via TIR: TIR interactions, which triggers downstream activation of the transcription factor NF-κB, to induce anti-pathogen responses. MAL works as a bridging adaptor for the association of MyD88 with TLR2 and 4 (Ve et al., 2015). \\nExcessive or prolonged activation of this signalosome may lead to chronic inﬂammatory diseases, so a broad spectrum anti-inflammatory drug can be designed by targeting the TLR2/4 pathways. TLR-antagonist design against the extracellular domains of the receptors has been explored, but with limited outcomes. Targeting downstream adaptor protein-protein interactions provides an alternative approach (O[[sqote]]Neill et al., 2009).\\nWe have recently shown that the MAL TIR domain spontaneously and reversibly forms filaments in vitro and cryo-EM (electron microscopy), mutational and cell-based studies have identified a conserved open-ended mode of TIR domain interaction that is important for the formation of a functional TLR4 signalosomes and NF-\\uf06bB activation(Ve et al., 2017). To identify small molecules that can inhibit the formation of these TIR domain assemblies, we have adopted a fragment-based drug design (FBDD) approach and screened a library of 400 fluorinated fragments for binding to MAL using 19F-NMR spectroscopy. 17 hits were identified from the 19F-NMR screen, and were validated by 15N-heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Structure-activity relationships (SAR) by catalogue and molecular docking have been adopted to identify commercial compounds that carry the scaffold of shortlisted fragments. A number of identified compounds have been shownto inhibit MAL TIR domain assemblyin vitro at µM concentrations.

       "  'Descr': 'The human microbiota consists of many different Gram-positive bacterial species from the Streptococcus genus, some of which are medically important due to their pathogenicity. As these streptococcal pathogens can cause a wide range of acute and severe infections (leading to death in some cases), it is crucial to study the virulence factors that contribute to their virulence. One identified family of these virulence factors is cholesterol dependent cytolysins (CDCs). CDCs are water-soluble, \\uf062-barrel pore-forming toxins that form doughnut-shaped homo-oligomeric complexes when bound to the lipid bilayer membranes of target cells such as erythrocytes and macrophages. The current dogma in the literature is that CDCs recognise cholesterol as the only cellular receptor for cell binding and pore-formation. However, previous studies on intermedilysin from S. intermedius and lectinolysin from S. mitis have called into question this belief as these CDCs were found to recognise other cellular receptors (glycoprotein CD59 for intermedilysin; Lewis B and Y antigens for lectinolysin) for cell binding. A recent study on streptolysin O (SLO) from S. pyogenes and pneumolysin (PLY) from S. pneumoniae has found that they were able to target the glycoconjugate receptors on erythrocytes and preliminary data has found that they were able to bound to the human CD11b I-domain of Macrophage receptor 1 (Mac-1) integrin protein complex. Therefore, the main aim of this study is to structurally characterise SLO and PLY in complex with the human CD11b I-domain via X-ray crystallography. This involves the expression and purification of full-length SLO and PLY and their respective Domain 4 as fusion proteins with N-terminal affinity tags via affinity chromatography and size exclusion chromatography. Future work also includes structural and functional characterisation of other streptococcal CDCs in complex with CD11b I-domain and Mac-1, and rational design of inhibitors for these CDCs.'},\n",

       "  'Descr': 'ABC toxin complexes are virulence factors found in a range of bacterial pathogens of insects and humans. To understand the activity and delivery mechanism of these protein complexes, we structurally characterised YenTc, a type-II ABC toxin complex that is the main determinant of virulence associated with the entomopathogenic bacterium Yersinia entomophaga. \\nRecently we determined a single-particle cryo-electron microscopy structure for YenTcA, providing new insights into the mechanisms that underpin the function of this ABC toxin complex. We were able to show that YenTc is a pore-forming toxin (Fig 1) and used in silico analyses to find structural evidence supporting a likely conformational change from the inactive pre-pore form to the biologically active pore form. The pre-pore form features a central α-helical bundle; the tip of which is particularly hydrophobic and likely protrudes from the complex and inserts into the lipid membrane in the pore form. A high-resolution structure of the YenTc pore form is not yet available; however, preliminary EM data gives us insights into its biochemical properties using various solubilisation methods to trigger the pore form and stabilise the hydrophobic tip. Studies of the YenTc pore form, as a representative type-II ABC toxin, may give us advantages in understanding host-pathogen interactions on structural and molecular levels using cryoEM and hybrid structure determination methods. The CMM membership will be utilised to acquire structures of different YenTc protein conformations and mutants.'},\n",

       "  'Descr': 'Giant high-grade ([[gt]]65 % Fe) hematite deposits hosted within Precambrian banded iron-formations (BIFs) represent the largest and most concentrated accumulations of iron known to man. Despite their economic significance and attracting decades of research, considerable controversy persists surrounding their genesis. Three distinct models for the formation of enriched iron ore bodies in BIFs have been put forward since the discussion livened 30 years ago: the syngenetic enrichment, supergene-metamorphic enrichment, and hypogene enrichment models. Most researchers agree upon the importance of a late-stage supergene process for final ore upgrading, however the significance of early metamorphism and hypogene processes remains controversial. Thus, this project aims to investigate the relative roles that tectonism, metamorphism, and hydrothermal alteration play in the enrichment of iron ore bodies in BIFs and reveal the significance of these processes through time. Micro-scale isotopic techniques (SHRIMP-SI, (U-Th)/He, (U-Th)/Ne, and 4He/3He) will be combined with structural field investigations to place constraints on the timing and geochemical environments of the mineralizing fluids. Absolute age determinations for ore mineralisation are critical for understanding the geological processes that control ore formation and will be used here to test the competing genetic models.\\n\\nSEM Job using EBSD absolute orientation needed.'},\n",

       "  'Descr': 'Estimating magma extrusion rates is a key factor in determining whether flood basalt magmatism may have triggered the environmental changes that cause mass extinctions. The Paraná Igneous Province (PIP), Brazil, is a voluminous and purportedly short-lived province with its major emplacement stage at 135±1 Ma, but there are doubts if this extrusion event caused mass extinctions. The Valanginian Oceanic Anoxic Event (OAE), which is commonly assumed to have been induced by the Paraná volcanism, seems to have preceded the main extrusion phase. Some authors suggest that extrusion could be more protracted than currently accepted because only the southern part of the PIP has been thoroughly dated. If the extrusion event was indeed longer than currently accepted, the Paraná event may not have promoted the drastic changes in the planet’s atmosphere that would have led to extinction events. To test whether extrusion is short- or long-lived, borehole samples from the northern PIP, traversing the entire volcanic stratigraphy in a volumetrically significant area that has not been previously investigated, are being currently dated by the 40Ar/39Ar incremental-heating method. New 40Ar/39Ar ages obtained from a stratigraphically well-constrained set of samples will provide a high-resolution chronostratigraphy for the volcanic sequence, allowing to test whether the northern and southern segments of the PIP were coevally erupted at 135 Ma. If the results reveal that the extrusion was indeed rapid and catastrophic, the age of the Valanginian OAE may have to be revised, as recently proposed.\\n\\nThe main aim of this research project is to obtain new 40Ar/39Ar ages for basaltic rocks from the Paraná Igneous Province, Brazil. For this purpose, a total of 36 whole-rock basalt samples were chosen to be analyzed by the 40Ar/39Ar laser step-heating method at The University of Queensland Argon Geochronology in Earth Sciences (UQ-AGES) laboratory. Therefore, sample characterization is indispensable for a detailed and well-constrained interpretation of the argon data results. The UQ-CMM facilities will be helpful to complement thin section analysis by providing: (1) detailed sample imaging by scanning electron microscopy (JEOL JSM-6610 SEM); (2) mineral chemistry data from electron microprobe analysis (JEOL JXA-8200 EPMA) for every major mineral phase in the rocks, especially plagioclase crystals; and (3) X-ray diffraction for clay mineral characterization. These procedures are expected to contribute to the identification of sample peculiarities and in this way improve the quality of the 40Ar/39Ar ages.'},\n",

As they are preferentially developed in tropical and subtropical coasts, classical studies defend the importance of the physicochemical factors (e.g., evaporation, seawater CaCO3 saturation, etc). Those hypotheses have limited ability to explain the exceptional occurrence of beachrocks at cold-temperate latitudes, thus emphasizing the role of other factors, including microbiological and anthropogenic processes (the outcrops contain tones of slag wastes derived from blast furnace of old steel factories).\\nPrevious studies defined a sequence of different cement generations: 1) Micritic high magnesium calcites (10-35 microns), followed by 2) Acicular aragonite cements (65-150 microns), and sporadically 3) iron oxide/oxyhydroxide ferruginous cements (e.g. hematite, goethite, limonite, etc), and meteoric cements such as 4) calcites or gypsum.\\nSome evidences (a possible biofilm around the grains, the existence of high magnesium calcites, some acidic organic macromolecules found with Raman Spectroscopy, etc.) suggest the possible initial microbiological controls on the nucleation of carbonates. This project aims to find those evidences to understand the organically mediated mineralization, to reproduce the process at laboratory scale and apply as bioremediation.\\nIndeed, natural beachrocks, have attracted their attention as models to understand accelerated microbial carbonate precipitation (MCP) due to its natural capability to co-precipitate metal ions, sequestrate CO2 and their implications in the fields of Bioengineering, Green Chemistry, Global Climatic Change, Materials science, etc.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Descr': 'Biological sulphate reduction (SR) is a microbial-mediated process to treat metal-containing wastewater from mining and metallurgical industry and recover metals (eg. Ni and Co) as precipitates. In this process, sulphate is reduced to sulphide with the existence of sulphate reducing bacteria (SRB) and substrate that can provide energy and electrons. Then the dissolved metals precipitate with the biologically produced sulphide and are recovered as metal sulphides. However, this biotechnology has not been widely used due to the challenging solid−liquid phase separation. Since the solubility product of metal sulphides is rather low, high levels of supersaturation occurs easily, which would lead to the generation of small particles (known as fines) that are difficult to settle. Nevertheless, sub-products accompanying biogenic sulphide produced in sulphate reducing bioreactors can affect characteristics of Ni/Co sulphide precipitates, such as their settling properties. The aim of this project is to study the impact of main components existing in biogenic sulphide, on settling properties of Ni/Co sulphides to create a baseline for the design and operation of a proper sulphate reducing bioreactor that allows high metal recovery efficiency.'},\n",

       "  'Descr': 'In agricultural cropping systems phosphours (P) is one of the most frequent yield-limiting nutrients, with 5.7 billion ha of land worldwide containing low levels of plant-available P. In low rainfall environments where water stress is common, concentrated P fertilizer bands are placed into the subsoil. However, observations in both the field and the laboratory show that the response to these deep applications of banded P are highly variable, presumably due to chemical transformations of the P fertilizers, which depend upon the form of P applied, the type co-applied nutrients, and the properties of the soil. Through an industry-funded research program, we are aiming to identify P reaction products in concentrated fertilizer bands over time. Specifically, we are aiming to understand (i) the influence of soil properties on the speciation and transformation of P in highly concentrated bands; (ii) to examine how the form of applied P influences the subsequent availability of that P; and (iii) to identify the underlying mechanisms by which co-application of potassium within the fertilizer band decreases the availability of the P. We hypothesize that the co-application of K will decrease availability due to the precipitation of taranakite in acid conditions as well as increase precipitation of Ca-phosphates in alkaline conditions.\\n\\nWe are applying two different approaches in order to study P availability and the underlying mechanisms by which co-application of potassium within the fertilizer band decreases the availability of the P. The first approach involves mapping of P in a DGT gel. For this wee incubate soil in a petri-dish and add fertilizer granules of interest to the centre. After a certain time of incubation, a DGT gel is placed across the soil to extract plant available P. We propose to use micro X-ray fluorescence to map changes of pant available P with increasing distance from fertilizer in the gel. Examining different soils, P forms and K provides information on how this factors influence fertilizer P movement. The second approach involves mapping of co-location of fertilizer P with Al, K, Si, Ca and Fe in bulk soil. For this, we conducted a soil incubation experiment aiming to identify P reaction products that form in concentrated fertilizer bands over time, as influenced by (i) P source, (ii) co-application of K, and (iii) soil properties. The P rate was estimated to mimic the fertosphere, i.e., the fertilizer enriched surrounding soil within 10 mm of the band, within the field. After incubating soil-fertilizer mixtures for up to six months, we propose to use micro X-ray fluorescence to examine elements associated with high P concentrations in the incubated soils. This information will be combined with results obtained from K-edge XANES which allow us identify fertilizer P reaction products in fertilizer bands.'},\n",

       "  'Descr': 'Zinc is an essential nutrient for plants and humans (Broadley et al. 2007; Tuerk and Fazel 2009), but many soils worldwide contain inadequate levels of this nutrient (Alloway 2008; Cakmak 2000). As a result, it is estimated that 49 % of the world’s important agricultural soils and one third of the world’s population suffer from Zn deficiency (Cakmak et al. 2010; Sillanpää 1990). Foliar fertilisation shows promise as a biofortification strategy to overcome Zn deficiency, especially when plants are at the stage where Zn is in high demand or when the soil-application of Zn fertilisers is ineffective due to edaphic factors such as high pH, high carbonate contents and organic matter contents (Fernandez and Brown 2013; Prasad et al. 2014b). New functional fertilisers, for example, foliar fertilisers with sustained and controlled release, are needed. Nano-fertilisers are promising in this regard given that they can be easily functionalised and potentially release nutrients to crops in a controlled manner, including sustained rates and target-specific effects (Liu and Lal 2015). \\n\\nCurrently, the processes regarding the foliar absorption of nutrients by plants and the translocation of the foliar absorbed nutrients in plants are not well understood. Especially, the potential roles of the cuticle, trichomes, and stomata on the foliar absorption of Zn remain unclear. As a consequence, almost current foliar fertilisers are not designed on a physiological basis, and hence suffer from various limitations. For instance, soluble Zn salts carry a high risk of scorching the leaves (Alloway 2008) and chelated forms of Zn such as Zn-EDTA, are under increased scrutiny due to associated environmental concerns (Oviedo and Rodríguez 2003). The present study aims to investigate the role of trichomes, stomata, and cuticle in foliar absorption of Zn, with the redistribution of Zn after absorption is also considered. These factors will be investigated using traditional approaches as well as synchrotron-based X-ray fluorescence microscopy (µ-XRF) and nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) – these allowing for in situ analsyes. The expected outcomes will assist in improving the understanding of foliar Zn absorption and translocation, thereby promoting the design of physiologically-based Zn foliar fertilisers and simultaneously minimising the threat to food security and human health.\\n'},\n",

During the pedogenesis of bauxite residues, calcium and alumina was removed from porewater with enhanced Na released to the rhizosphere.

Serpentine contains predominantly magnesium and silica, with metals such as nickel distributed throughout the lattice. It is anticipated when leaching with a Ph swing the extraction of metals will be high, and the solid residue will be predominantly silica possibly with some triethylamine. The original antigorite sample will also be analysed to assess for the presence of asbestos fibres.\\n\\nSEM will be used to compare the surface structure of the residue after leaching with that of the original antigorite sample. It is expected that for the sample produced from leaching will have different morphology and the presence of metals such as magnesium should be much less. The analysis will also confirm whether or not the antigorite contains any asbestos fibres.'},\n",

       "  'Descr': 'Current understanding on macrophage functional plasticity is mostly surrounding cytokines and chemokines influence on polarization state, however the complexity of the microenvironment in which these cells exist necessitate consideration of other factors. There is growing research to support macrophage phenotype regulation using biophysical and mechanical cues of the microenvironment, such as matrix stiffness, topography, architecture and composition. Most existing studies in this area are limited to 2- or 2.5-Dimensional models which does not accurately translate to the 3D microenvironment, nor recapitulate the complexity of in vivo tissue.\\nIt is proposed that healing and scare formation is not just regulated by the well characterised role of biochemical signalling by cytokines and chemokines, but also transduction of biophysical stimuli through cell interactions with the microenvironment in the ECM. Therefore, by understanding the early immune outcomes on the spatiotemporally regulated mechanisms of wound healing, smart biomaterials can be generated to guide and/or promote immune regulation to reduce fibrosis/scarring after burn injury and thus achieve scarless wound healing.\\nTo investigate the effect of the physical microenvironment on monocyte differentiation and macrophage plasticity, a 3-dimensional defined and controlled system must be established to effectively mimic ECM microenvironments. For this project, both a naturally and synthetically derived system will be used to observe correlations between ECM mechanics and cell fate changes, both of which have been previously established and optimised by members of the Rowan Group.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Descr': 'The project involves the study of different types of coal mine spoil (sedimentary waste rock material) for the capacity to generate salt. This generally occurs when the sample is leached i.e. water is added. While the most common salt to generate electrical conductivity (EC) is halite (NaCl), some spoil samples also contain gypsum (CaSO4.2H2O) and epsomite (MgSO4.7H2O). These salts will be contained within the dry spoil, and may enter the leachate as dissolved ions in aqueous form by dissolution or adsorption/desorption.\\n\\nIn general, the spoil samples will be composed of varying amounts of quartz, feldspar, and clay minerals such as kaolinite, illite, and montmorillonite. The amount of clay has the strongest influence on the generation of salt and the rate at which the rocks degrade to release their salts. \\n\\nWhile mineral composition can be investigated using light microscopy, the type of clay minerals present cannot be identified without using SEM, due to their fine grain size. It has been postulated, but not proven, that montmorillonite clays generate much more salt than kaolinite (or illite to a certain extent).\\n\\nThe various clay minerals can be identified by their morphology using a basic topographical analysis and secondary electrons. The composition of the spoil would also be valuable information, using backscattered electrons and/or microanalysis. Another possibility would be the image capture and identification of any fossilised salts contained within the spoil.\\n\\nFor analysis, dry spoil has been crushed and sieved to a topsize of 2mm.

We will compare petrological data with geophysical monitoring at ‘regular arc’ (calc-alkaline) to ‘anomalous’ (high-alkali) volcanoes, to constrain key differences in the architecture and dynamics of the magmatic systems feeding volcanism. Project results will make it possible to build updated models on magma ascent and eruption mechanisms, and improve our understanding on volcanic hazards, emergency management and economic ore potential in arc settings. As such, the project aligns directly with the ARC-Discovery 3-year project recently awarded to Dr. Ubide and Dr. Rosenbaum.\\n\\nAIM: Through analyzing samples collected by myself as well as sent to us from our collaborators at the Ecuadorian volcano observatory, we will be using high-resolution geochemistry to examine mineral and melt signatures. Furthermore, we will use analytical facilities at the UQ-RIF lab, including laser ablation mass spectrometry optimised by supervisor Dr Ubide. We will also use UQ-SEES SEM technologies and the UQ-CMM electron microprobe. This project will improve our understanding on the complex magmatic pathways feeding volcanic activity at arc volcanoes, with implications to the development of ore deposits, in alignment with the ARC-DP.

The incorporation of SEM-EDS will be used to increase the resolution and reliability of residue identification. Specifically, differentiation between ochre and resin is sought to address the antiquity of hafting. This study demonstrates the potential for future residue and use-wear analysis of quartz artefacts from sites in northern Australia to reveal information on resource provisioning, site-activity and instances of composite tool use.'},\n",

       "  'Descr': 'In the water-energy nexus, one of the greatest opportunities for reducing energy consumption is the energy for water and wastewater treatment. Water purification with solar energy is one of the most promising ways in capitalizing this opportunity. The supply of energy from the Sun to the Earth is 3 x 1024 joules a year, about 10,000 times more than the current global energy consumption. It has been a shared dream for long to utilize the full-spectrum of solar energy for driving photocatalytic processes underlying water decontamination and hydrogen production. The technological central piece to realizing this dream is finding the ‘magic’ material that is able to absorb and convert the full spectrum of solar energy to electrochemical energy. TiO2 has been a favoured material for this purpose owing to its abundance, stability, processability, and mechanical robustness; however, its application is severely limited because it only absorbs UV if unmodified. Various approaches have been used to broaden the absorbance band of TiO2 but with limited success in the visible and little progress in NIR. The aim of this project is to synthesize a novel class of hierarchically ordered porous TiO2 structures as intensified photocatalytic microreactors using the full-spectrum of solar energy.'},\n",

Compared with traditional fabrication method of graphene, laser reduction has the advantage of being an easy, fast and no-chemical process. In these papers, various precursors, including GO in solution, GO in film and PI were adopted for laser reduction. The mechanisms of the laser reduction was also discussed. Furthermore, LRG application for different devices are investigated. After the literature review, some potential applications, such as antenna and strain sensor, the conductivity enhancement of LRG and after packaging treatment of laser, were discussed. Some initial research of LRG was demonstrated. After laser irradiation, the width of laser reduced graphene line can be less than one micrometer, and the electrical conductivity of laser reduced graphene can be improved to 45.5 S/m. It was noticed that the ratio of C-C sp2 bonds to C-C sp3 bonds was greatly increased from 2.66 to 8.19, which demonstrates the effective restoration of C-C sp3 to C-C sp2 with fs laser irradiation.'},\n",

       "  'Descr': 'Due to the world’s growing energy demands, pollution concerns, and reliance upon limited fossil fuels, there has recently been significant interest in the development of fuel cells that can convert the chemical energy of carbon or biomass directly into electricity without a reformation process.  The direct carbon fuel cells (DCFCs) are the most efficient and environmentally friendly technology to convert solid carbon energy to electricity without the need for combustion or gasification. The thermodynamic efficiency of the DCFCs can reach up to 100% and the produced off-gas in the anode compartment is almost pure CO2 which can be easily collected for industrial use or sequestration. Therefore, it could have a major impact on reducing fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. However, the development of DCFCs to commercialisation stage is largely prohibited by their poor power densities due to the high resistive loss from the anode. The aim of this thesis is to improve the performance of the DCFC through fundamental studies on the anode of solid electrolyte-based DCFCs. (Ron: Has EPMA licence)'},\n",

Unlike the Li-ion battery, the Li-S battery (LSB) produces a range of lithium polysulfides (PSs) during operation. During operation, these PS dissolve into and subsequently precipitate out of the electrolyte. Furthermore, the PS interact with the Li electrode. The combination of PS interaction and dissolution leads to poor LSB durability. It is anticipated that the gravimetric energy density of Li-S batteries will be ≈ 400-600 Wh kg −1, but this has yet to be realized. The main purpose of our research is to develop LSB that outperforms the currently available Li-ion battery with improved energy density and durability. \\nOne main approach will be considered in this presentation – altering the separator. Currently a simple Celgard membrane is used as a separator, however, if a separator can be found that can trap or block PS migration to the Li electrode this will improve the LSB durability\\n\\nComment SC: need Interview\\n'},\n",

Continuous digital hypothermia (CDH) is an effective preventative and treatment for sepsis-associated laminitis, however it is unknown whether CDH is effective in endocrinopathic laminitis. Furthermore, the effects of CDH on the ultrastructure of the lamellar is unknown in all forms of laminitis. We hypothesise CDH prevents ultrastructural pathology of the lamellar.

The proposed research will also focus on the understanding of the new reaction pathways and mechanism at atomic scale in above S-HSMs. This will be fairly promising in on/off-board hydrogen storage area because of the high hydrogen storage capacity with rapid kinectics at mild temperature range. In addition, we will explore different synthetic routes to optimize material performance of monoatomic metals doped carbon-based nanomaterials.\\n\\nWith the opportunities provided by CMM,I can use the instruments, such as SEM, TEM, XPS and so on, to characterize the morphology structure and property of the synthesized materials. Such information can help us analyze the reaction mechanism of hydrogen uptake. For example, with the XPS experiment, we can obtain the valence states of metal atoms before and after the hydrogen absorption, then further analyze the binding modes of hydrogen with metal atoms.Moreover, the results of the tests are also helpful for us to further optimize the properties of materials.\\n'},\n",

To increase the reaction rate and lower the overpotential, many superior catalysts have been explored toward HER and OER. Currently, Pt and Ir/Ru based materials are the commercial catalysts for HER and OER, respectively. However, the high cost and scarcity of these noble metal-based catalysts are the present barriers for their large scale deployment. Thus, it becomes urgent to exploit alternative electrocatalysts with high efficiency and low cost. This project will focus on exploring carbon defects based catalysts used in HER, OER and ORR. In our previous study, we reported the high activity and remarkable durability of carbon defects as tri-functional catalyst in electrocatalysis. In this project, the defective carbon is served as the support for single metal atoms, which will probably exhibit high performance contributed by the synergistic effect between the defects and the dopants.'},\n",

       "  'Descr': 'Electrospinning is a relatively economical and simple method to produce uniform and continuous nanoscale fibers (nanofibers) from almost any synthetic and many natural polymers. The nanofibers membranes have attracted special attention due to their high specific surface area, tunable pore size, and flexibility. A wide range of bioactive agents such as antibiotics, liposomes, chitosan, nanoparticles and proteins have been incorporated by various techniques into nanofibers that exhibit therapeutics effects in standard assays. In addition, coaxial electrospinning is an attractive strategy for the delivery of susceptible biomolecules because the produced core−shell fibers have great potential to preserve proteins during the electrospinning process. Recent progress in the preparation of protein-compatible nanofibers has improved the preservation of protein activity. In this case, however, proteins still remain in polymeric solutions and are not in their natural aqueous microenvironment. This shortcoming can be solved by the use of nanoparticles. Nanomaterials with hollow structures and large cone-shaped pores, such as HMSN-LP developed by Dr. Chun Xu, could be a promising candidate to be incorporated with core-shell nanofiber as an advanced complex drug delivery system. Hence, the aim of this study is to develop a membrane consisting of nanofibers incorporated nanoparticles as a drug delivery system for controlled therapeutics protein release.\\n\\nThe morphology of produced core-shell nanofibers can be better investigated using TEM.'},\n",

Mutations in this protein contributes to primary microcephaly progression during development.\\n\\nThe project is focused on characterizing the molecular and cellular functions of WDR62 during brain development. Using mouse embryonic fibroblasts we are aiming to investigate WDR62 role in centrosome and cilia structure as a deficiency in centrosomes and cilia could underlay neuro-developmental defects that occur in WDR62 mutations.

They are receiving increasing academic interest because of their potential use in phytotechnologies. New Caledonia is global hotspot for hyperaccumulator plants, with 65 nickel and 11 manganese hyperaccumulator plant species recorded to date. The proposed experiment aims to spatially resolve the elemental distribution in five different New Caledonian Ni hyperaccumulator plant species namely, Geissois pruinosa (Cunoniaceae), Homalium kanaliense (Salicaceae), Hybanthus austrocaledonicus (Violaceae), Psychotria gabriellae (Rubiaceae), and Pycnandra acuminata (Sapotaceae). Initially using SEM-EDS (before further using μXRF imaging) of different plant tissues, from the roots to the shoots and reproductive organs, we intend to clarify how distribution patterns of Ni, and those of other physiologically relevant elements (Ca, K, Mn, Zn), differ between these species. This investigation builds on existing knowledge to shed light on the evolution of hyperaccumulation in the flora of New Caledonia.

Indeed, ticks transmit more pathogens (bacteria, viruses and parasitic protozoa) to their hosts than all of the biting insects combined (mosquitoes, fleas, bugs, sandflies etc). Yet, the ticks of Australia are poorly known. The first and last tick-specialist in Australia was Dr F.H.S Roberts of CSIRO, Brisbane (1901-1972). My background in the ticks of Brazil (my Masters thesis) has me well placed to make a substantial contribution to the study of Australasian ticks. First, I would review the conceptual development of the field of tick-biology in Australasia from the first paper on the biology of an Australasian tick, by Dr Joseph Bancrofti in 1888, on paralysis in dogs caused by the eastern paralysis tick, Ixodes holocyclus, to the present. This will provide a foundation for the next century or so of study of the ticks of Australasia. Then, I would describe, a number of new species of ticks and the males and nymphs of a number of other species of ticks from Australia, New Guinea and New Zealand. These specimens are present in museum collections in Australia and in the National Tick Collection of The United States of America, which is much the largest tick collection in the world ([[gt]] 1 million specimens). Then, I will study the host-ranges, geographic distributions, pathogenicity, life-history of these and other ticks, particularly the so-called paralysis ticks of Australasia (the subgenus Sternalixodes).\\n\\nMy aim is to discover new species of ticks based on morphology.'},\n",

       "  'Descr': 'Multiturn time-of-flight mass analysers have been developed to increase the flight path distance in order achieve higher mass resolving power for biomolecules. Multi-pass time-of-flight is likely one of the means of increasing the mass resolving power of mass spectrometers which we will see more of in the future. The first commercially available instrument of this type is the Jeol Spiral TOF, which can achieve mass resolving power in excess of 75000, in contrast to approximately 40000 on the best of the reflectron MALDI-TOF instruments. During this project, we propose to develop several matrix deposition approaches to ionise lipids from Mouse Brain samples. Specifically piezo spray, nebulised spray and sublimation approaches will be investigated. Piezo spray approaches typically produce strong signal but suffer from analyte redistribution, and nebulised spray and sublimation allow for higher spatial resolution due to small crystal size but reduced signal due to poorer analyte co-crystallisation with the matrix material. This study will seek to trial a number of different conditions using the nebulised spray approach where we are attempt increase the wetness of the spray without adversely affecting the analyte distribution. The control sample for assessment of signal strength will be the piezo sprayed sample. Experiments will be conducted using serial section of mouse brain. The ultimate goal is to achieve improved results using the nebulised spray approach, and finally determine the smallest pixel size that can use utilised using the Spiral TOF analyser for samples prepared using the nebulised spray approach.\\n\\nAIM: MALDI Mass spectrometers'},\n",

       "  'Descr': 'Ultra High Temperature Ceramics (UHTCs) are at the forefront of materials research as the aerospace industry and other high-tech sectors become limited in vision and scope by the shortfalls of the current generation of materials. The race is on to find a candidate material to replace C/C-SiC composites in all high temperature high strength environments. For UHTCs to improve on the current generation issues such as thermal shock, high temperature oxidation, strength and fracture toughness must be overcome. Incorporation of UHTCs into composite structures hopes to alleviate many of these issues.\\n\\nThe research covered all refractory elements and common sintering aids. Viable sintering, processing and infiltration methods were outlined and compared. The research indicated that carbides had the highest melting temperatures but diboride structures had more competitive thermal conductivity and tensile strengths. \\n\\nThe thesis was split into five key phases: procurement, synthesis, processing, testing and analysis. The synthesis phase investigated the additions of Si and C powders. Slurries were produced that behaved like a fluid but had higher carbon yield.  Sample batches with graduated batch percentages of 5%, 10%, 20% were produced and compared at a stoichiometric ratio. These slurries were mixed in conjunction with Starfire resins to be infiltrated into the carbon composite (C/C) structures. \\n\\nOnce the slurry infiltration process for SiC was perfected, ZrB¬2-ZrSi2¬- mixtures were prepared by wet mixing in ethanol media. The biggest challenge to the production of C/C-ZrB¬2-SiO2-B2O3 is the high temperature required to achieve full densification. Mass production of composites and capabilities of the most common autoclaves do not allow temperatures above 2000 O.N. Grigoriev demonstrated that higher levels of ZrSi¬¬¬¬2 promoted the densification of the composite structure. Gao et al. determined that for compositions greater than 20wt % ZrSi2, 99% densification is achieved. The SiO2 and B2O3 were found to react and produce an intergranular liquid phase at 1500°C, this liquid phase is a key mechanism of densification.\\n\\nBoth the C/C-SiC [[and]] C/C-ZrB¬2-ZrSi2 composites were formed into 100x100mm plates and further subdivided to provide samples to test for: Microstructural properties, temperature resistance, flexural strength, impact and oxidation. This was done using 3-pt bending, the DCM technique, SEM analysis and oxyacetylene testing. The performance of the new composite architecture of the C/C-ZrB¬2-ZrSi2 will then be compared to the existing C/C-SiC.\\n'},\n",

However gill samples from infected fish frequently present a mixed assemblage of amoeba species (Bermingham and Mulcahy 2007, Howard 2001). Neoparamoeba perurans has also been isolated from asymptomatic and healthy Atlantic salmon. The Fish Health Team at CSIRO is working with our industry partner, Tassal and European collaborators to investigate whether N. perurans is the only causative agent of AGD in Atlantic salmon, and whether the virulence of AGD infection is influenced by other marine or freshwater amoebae species. These findings could promote improvements to treatment regimes. CMM will assist in documenting the cellular structures which will be used to identify the species of amoeba isolated from AGD-affected fish.'},\n",

Despite its magnitude, however, our knowledge of how these cells die during involution remains incomplete. One of the mechanisms proposed to be involved in sensing and transducing pro-death signals during mammary gland involution is epithelial mechanosensation. Mechanosensitive ion channels regulate a range of processes in the body, including hearing, touch, pain and blood pressure. In addition, the recently-identified Piezo1 mechanosensitive channel was shown to regulate both cell proliferation (in response to epithelial cell stretching in areas of low cell density) and cell death (in response to epithelial crowding in areas of high cell density) in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Here we investigate roles for mechanosensitive channels in postlactational involution.'},\n",

Scanning Electron Microscopic (SEM) observation and Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) analysis were adopted to have a deep understanding on microstructure evolution. Microscopic results of the investigation show that there is almost no variation of grains, with respect to Kernel Average Misorientation (KAM) value and rotation of the grains, in the undeformed areas. Rotation of the grains is observed between inner edge and outer surface regions. The microscopic analysis also revealed that the KAM distribution shifts to higher values at the highly deformed region.'},\n",

The SNARE protein on the vesicle (v-SNARE) forms a complex with SNAREs on the target membrane (t-SNAREs). Formation of the SNARE complex leads to membrane docking and fusion. Munc18a is essential for neurotransmission release and binds specifically to its cognate Sx1a. The Munc18a/Sx1a crystal structure showed that Munc18a binds to Sx1a in a closed conformation that is incompatible with SNARE complex formation (Burkardt, 2008). We obtained the crystal structure of neuronal Munc18a bound to a non-cognate Sx4 N-peptide (Hu, 2011). Munc18a has been shown to bind to SNARE complex by pull-down and liposome assays.

During this course, it is discovered that the polymers containing nitroxide radical (NRPs) show the higher potential (3.6 V vs Li/Li+) than most of other redox groups and can be an ideal polymer cathode. Despite their theoretical two-electron redox process, most of studies on NRPs only focus on their one-electron energy storage, resulting in a theoretical maximum capacity of ~110 mAh g-1. Even occasional two-electron transfer has been reported, the reason remains unclear. .  In this context, there is a great opportunity for us to develop new NRPs electrode composites to achieve a powerful plastic battery that can deliver high potential (i.e. [[gt]]3.0 V) and high capacity (i.e. [[gt]]200 mAh g-1). \\n\\nMorphology of polymer carbon composite materials \\n'},\n",

       "  'Descr': 'Viral infections are a primary cause of epidemics and therefore remain critical worldwide. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection is the cause of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) that has caused morbidity, mortality due to public health cost in  both the developed and developing world but currently in developed countries  significant issue is related to public health cost. Infection with Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) are endemic in both the developed and developing world and are major contributors to the risk of liver cancer and cervical cancer, respectively. Furthermore, the recent haemorrhagic fever epidemics caused by Ebola Virus (EBoV) in parts of West Africa have caused several thousands of deaths. Therefore, worldwide, a considerable burden of disease is caused by viral infection. In the last two decades, approximately 30,000 AAA+ proteins have been identified, including vacuolar protein sorting 4 (Vps4) which is a critical host factor that is hijacked by clinically significant enveloped viruses including Ebola and HIV to enable the virus budding process. Vps4 uses the energy of ATP hydrolysis to recycle the vesicle machinery and ensure the sustainability of the process. Vps4p-dependent ATP hydrolysis can be considered the driving force for vesicle budding. The treatment of viral infection remains a challenge. Antiviral drugs are currently available for only a limited range of viral infections (e.g. influenza, Herpes). There is still no vaccine that offers effective protection against HIV. Moreover, there are numerous examples of newly emerging viruses, including, in Australia, Lyssa Virus and Hendra Virus. Vaccines against such newly emerging viruses may take many years to develop. Therefore, we propose here to screen extracts of marine invertebrates for low molecular weight Vps4p inhibitors using an assay based on subcellular Vps4p localisation. Our expectation is that the inhibitory compounds identified in our screen using live cells will inhibit the ATPase activity of wild type Vps4 in vitro. The ability of these compounds to inhibit virus budding in cell culture will then be addressed via collaboration with laboratories that have these assays already established.\\n\\nWe incubated the cells expressing wild type Vps4-GFP with each crude extract and then examine the distribution of Vps4-GFP in the cells by confocal microscopy. When Vps4 is active it give subcellular distribution and when inhibited by compund its becomes inactive and give punctate appearances in the cell. Confocal microscopy is the best to observe yeast cells and for high resolution images.'},\n",

Two of the most striking findings correspond to ceroid deposition in various organs and a membranous glomerulonephritis, a nephropathy often caused by the deposition of immunoglobulins that lead to renal insufficiency such as in the present case. To date, there are no reports in the literature in marsupials or related mammals resembling this case. However in humans, the late complication of one rare form of an autosomal recessive disorder denominated ‘Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome’ is characterized by ceroid deposition in many organs leading to dysfunction, as well as renal insufficiency from IgA nephropathies and other types of glomerulonephritis/glomerulosclerosis.

       "  'Descr': 'Barrick Gold Corporation has a sub-economic refractory gold ore body with content of muscovite. Muscovite is a hydrophilic, platy micaceous mineral, classified as a phyllosilicate. Previous research identified that micas and clays have a deleterious effect on the flotation of sulfide minerals. The presence of muscovite is associated with increase in pulp viscosity, formation of slime coatings and high recovery of muscovite through entrainment (Wang et al. (2015), Forbes et al. (2014), Ndlovu, Farrokhpay, [[and]] Bradshaw (2013), Connelly (2011); He et al. (2009)). Most previous studies relating to the effect of mica and clays on sulfide minerals were conducted using copper ores. The effect of the presence of muscovite on the flotation of pyritic gold-bearing minerals is not well understood. This work investigates the flotation behaviour of muscovite and its effect on pyrite and arsenopyrite floatability at laboratory-scale using a synthetic sample consisting of pyrite, arsenopyrite, quartz (silica) and muscovite. The objective is to provide to Barrick a mechanism of recovery of muscovite and to quantify its deleterious effects in gold bearing pyrites. The experimental program applied a Central Composite Rotatable Design (CCRD) to quantify and model the effect of muscovite in the flotation of gold-bearing pyritic minerals and the results are discussed in terms of the floatability of pyrite, the degree of entrainment and the viscosity of the pulp. It is expected that this work could clarify if the effective removal of muscovite from the flotation feed will bring a capital benefit to the flotation circuit of Barrick.\\n\\nI[[sqote]]m aiming to understand the state of oxidation of the surface of pyrite and arsenopyrite in the samples submitted for XPS'},\n",

       "  'Descr': 'Australian Elapid snakes include some of the most venomous snakes in the world, with Brown Snakes (Pseudonaja) and Taipans (Oxyuranus) being some of the most medically important snakes in Australia. Species within the Pseudonaja–Oxyuranus clade contain large quantities of procoagulant toxins in their venom, which often leads to VICC (Venom-induced Consumption Coagulopathy) being a prominent pathology in snakebite victims. To date, in vitro research has shown that the coagulotoxins from these snakes produce strong fibrin clots which do not readily break down. However, our research, which spans more species and localities than previously tested, contradicts previous work and has revealed much weaker clots consistently being produced by Pseudonaja species compared to Oxyuranus species. To visualise the difference in fibrin clot structure produced by the venoms of these two genera, we will produce Scanning Electron Microscopy images of the resulting clots, as well as determine the source of fibrin deformation (e.g. a deformed thrombin produced by the prothrombinase complex, leading to aberrant fibrinogen splicing). Given that Pseudonaja species are the cause of more snakebite deaths in Australia than any other species, our results from this study may have important clinical implications for the treatment of Pseudonaja bites.\\n\\nWe aim to acquire SEM images of normal vs. deformed fibrin clots created by various snake venoms. We will add these results to our paper for submission to an international, high-ranking journal. A figure for our paper will show the surface topography, geometry, and composition of the fibrin clot sample. I believe we may need Field Emission SEM, but this is to be confirmed by Kathryn Green.'},\n",

Thus, there is increasing interest in novel feed additives such as probiotics for improving animal performance, including gut health. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms by which probiotics work in order to improve feed conversion ratios and functionally replace AGPs whilst maintaining efficiency within production animal industries. \\nThe aim of this project is to characterise the mechanism of action of novel Bacillus probiotics within the animal GIT. All experiments will employ a bioassay method, in order to maximise feasibility and reproducibility of poultry studies. A benefit of this work will help assist scientists with rapid feedback of probiotics that have a proven efficacy through targeting and developing specific mechanistic properties. \\nThe objectives of this study aim to assess the effect of novel Bacillus probiotics on the function of the poultry gastrointestinal microbiota. The experiments also aim to assist in the explanation of the action of this potential probiotic, through measuring digestibility of feed ingredients and enzyme activity through the poultry gastrointestinal tract. The project objectives are:\\n1.\\tTo perform a systematic review of Bacillus probiotics in poultry to assist in hypothesis generation regarding the potential mechanisms of probiotic action\\n2.\\tEvaluate novel probiotics in a poultry model\\n3.\\tInvestigate the mechanisms of action of probiotic products on poultry gut health.\\n\\nHence, the use of electron microscopy to analyse the poultry gastrointestinal tract (small intestine) will further assist in understanding possible mechanisms of probiotic action.\\n\\nAIM: The literature surrounding histomorphology measurement in the poultry gastrointestinal tract measures villus height (VH) and crypt depth (CD) of the small intestine. Such improvements in VH and CD of the small intestine segments of have been correlated with increased growth performance of poultry when fed feed supplements such as enzymes and probiotics. Hence, my aim is to measure this as part of the gut in addition to my data collection to further elucidate the mechanisms of enzyme and or probitoic action in the monogastic gut.'},\n",

       "  'Descr': 'Human parainfluenza viruses are responsible for a variety of upper and lower respiratory tract illnesses. Human parainfluenza virus type 1 (hPIV- 1) in particular, is responsible for causing croup, which commonly requires patient hospitalisation in severe cases. Despite ongoing research efforts, there are no antiviral drugs or vaccines that have been clinically approved to treat hPIV-1 infections to date, which reinforces the urgency for developing novel therapeutic approaches. Current research endeavours are focused on an important surface glycoprotein, haemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN), which plays a crucial role in virus attachment, fusion and release. In recent years, researchers have attempted to crystallise hPIV- 1 HN, in order to conduct insightful, structure-guided investigations to understand the structural basis of host-cell binding and membrane fusion activation. However, all crystallisation attempts to date have not yielded viable crystals. Identifying and characterising the important structural properties of hPIV- 1 HN is a key investigative step in novel antiviral drug discovery. Therefore, the primary objective of this project is to explore new strategies to successfully obtain the three-dimensional structure of hPIV-1 HN. This study will utilise a variety of structural biology techniques such as X-ray crystallography, negative stain and cryo-electron microscopy to resolve the structure of hPIV-1 HN. In summary, this project presents several avenues for gaining novel insights into the structural properties of hPIV-1 HN, in order to assist with the design of future hPIV-1 inhibitors with strong specificity and efficacy.\\n\\nAim: Perform crystallisation experiments using the Mosquito and RockImager instruments'},\n",

       "  'Descr': 'Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a childhood disease, which may be associated with severe life-threatening complications, for which there is currently no treatment. HFMD is primarily caused by infection with Coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16) and is also associated with enterovirus 71 (EV71). To initiate infection, the analogous, non-enveloped EV71 and CV-A16 particles engage with cellular receptors including scavenger receptor B2 (SCARB2), P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL-1) and heparan sulfate (HS) and EV71 is also suggested to bind to sialylated glycans. Our research has focused on the development of inhibitors which mimic these receptors however to continue advancing this research we require a detailed understanding of the molecular interactions involved. In addition to HS, EV71 and CV-A16 are suspected to bind to other types of sugars such as sialic acid. However, the mechanism by which these sugar receptors and our receptor mimetics bind to the virus capsid remains unknown. Moreover, virus clinical isolates have a variable dependence towards cellular receptors, expressed in variable levels in cell lines. These knowledge gaps are a limitation to the current development of potent EV71 and CV-A16 binding inhibitors.\\nThere are cryoEM structures available for EV71 [1, 2] and CV-A16 [3] to 2.9 Å and 3.1 Å, respectively and we will be looking to resolve the structures of these viruses and clinical isolates in complex with our inhibitors and the cellular receptors recognised by these viruses. Virus purification will be performed similarly to described for these EM structures and according to the recent publication from the von Itzstein lab [4]:\\nVirus purification. Clarified supernatants of infection were treated with 8% PEG-8000, 0.4M NaCl for 24h at 4°C. The virus was then pelleted by centrifugation for 45min at 5,000gat 4°C, the pellet resuspended in PBS and dounce-homogenised. The resuspended virus was loaded onto a 20% sucrose cushion in PBS and ultracentrifuged for 3h at 4°C and 130,000gusing a Beckman SW31.1 Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). The resulting pellet was resuspended in PBS, loaded onto a non-linear 20%—50% sucrose gradient in PBS and ultracentrifuged again for 3h at 4°C and 130,000g. The 40% and 50% sucrose cushions were collected, diluted in PBS and the virus was pelleted twice by 2 successive rounds of ultracentrifugation to get rid of sucrose, each for 3h at 4°C and 130,000g. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 250μL of deuterated PBS and the virus was UV-inactivated for 20min for NMR experiments.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Descr': 'Agmatine is a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator involved in a number of different neurological processes such as behavioural control and the processing of emotions. As well as this, agmatine has been linked to a number of neurological disorders such as alcohol addiction, depression and schizophrenic behaviour. Agmatinases are enzymes found in both bacteria and mammals, which are able to hydrolyse and hence control levels of agmatine. Bacterial agmatinases are well studied in regards to structure and function whereas very little is known about the mammalian enzymes. This is mainly due to a lack of activity in recombinantly expressed mammalian agmatinases coupled with low yields. Recently an enzyme was identified in the rat brain that displayed agmatinase activity while maintaining extremely low levels of sequence identity with the known agmatinases (around 15%), and hence given the name Agmatinase-Like Protein (ALP). In addition to low sequence homology ALP contains a region encoding a LIM domain. This domain, which is not present in any of the agmatinases, is commonly found in mammalian enzymes and serves as a regulatory and protein-protein interaction domain. An ALP homologue has also been identified in humans. As a potential mediator of cognitive function this enzyme serves as a promising target for the development of therapeutic drugs for the treatment cognitive disorders such as those highlighted above.\\n\\nI aim to determine the crystal structure of the protein described above using the crystallography equipment in the UQROCX facility.'},\n",

The global aim of this project is to develop nanomaterials that can selectively and sensitively detect trace amounts of disease markers. Different diseases are usually characterised by abnormal production of chemical species, which can then be used as chemical markers for disease.  Hence, detection of abnormal levels has the potential to serve as an early screening method.\\n\\nThis project will construct sensors that will be comprised of a nanostructured substrate, which will be coated with molecular switches that serve as transducers.  The molecules will specifically interact with the molecular switch, which will undergo a change in structure.  This change in structure will be able to be optically detected due to the enhanced optical effects imparted by the nanostructured substrate. \\n\\nWe are aiming to discover the morphology and size of the gold nanoparticle assemblies aided by TEM. \\n'},\n",

       "  'Descr': 'A fundamental goal in neuroscience is to better understand how the brain is able to integrate sensory information taken from the external world, combine it with previous experience and internal state, and generate a relevant behavior in response. We use the highly accessible brains of insects to illuminate the neural basis of this fundamental process. Despite their small size, insect brains generate a variety of highly complex navigational behaviors. These provide a behavioral framework within which we study the computational mechanisms of elementary navigational decisions at the level of single neurons. A conserved brain region known as the central complex (CX) plays a vital role in navigation, sensory integration, and action selection. A complex ensemble of neurons that form a highly regular network of tightly interwoven neural processes underlies all CX computations, generating a circuit characterized by an exceptionally close coupling of structure and function. How does this conserved circuitry enable an insect to navigate in its environment? How does this circuitry change between species using different navigational strategies? We are pursuing the answers to these questions by comparing the CX neuroarchitecture across six species of bees and ants, each of which either has a different strategy of navigation (path integration, landmark navigation, pheromone tracking), or differs in its preferred mode of locomotion (flying versus walking). We will comprehensively trace all major neurons of the CX across these species using block-face electron microscopy and establish local connectomes of computational modules of the CX in a subset of species. This will illuminate the information flow within the CX and allow to construct anatomically constrained models of the fundamental computational processes in this brain region. As a proof of concept, we have generated a preliminary map of all columnar neurons of the bumblebee CX, which will serve as foundation and roadmap for all anatomical work across the remaining species. Once we have established these unprecedented neuroanatomical maps, we will intracellularly record from individual neurons in those species showing the most divergent anatomical features. This will elucidate the functional role of specific neural elements within the CX circuit in the context of navigational decisions and lead the way towards understanding how coherent navigational strategies result from simple, elementary orientation decisions.'},\n",

       "  'Descr': 'Motor neurone disease (MND) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder, characterised by synaptic degeneration. To elucidate the genetic component of sporadic MND, an international genome- wide association study (GWAS) was performed in 2016, followed by a meta-analysis in 2017. These genetic analyses determined that the genes SCFD1 and GGNBP2 were associated with MND, however their purported role in MND pathogenesis has not been determined. To elucidate the function of these potential MND genes, the Millard laboratory performed knockdown and overexpression experiments in Drosophila melanogaster for Slh (SCFD1 fly homologue) and GGNBP2 respectively. The results of these experiments revealed that the genes caused synaptic morphology defects at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), thus providing a mechanistic link between the function of these genes and MND pathology. To better mimic the loss of function phenotypes seen in MND mutations, CRISPR technology was subsequently utilised to generate Slh and GGNBP2 null mutants. This project has two aims: to determine the validity of Slh and GGNBP2 as MND genes and secondly to confirm whether there is functional conservation between the Drosophila genes and their human homologues. These goals will be achieved by characterising the synaptic morphology of the null mutants and performing rescue experiments using the human homologues of Slh and GGNBP2.'},\n",

       "  'Descr': 'Starch is a staple food and one of the major energy sources for people. The digestion rate of starch in foods has been strongly related to metabolic diseases such as diabetes. A rapid digestion of starch causes a shape increase of blood sugar level which could lead to obesity or diabetes. Pectin is a common food additive and naturally occurring food component and has been proven to have benefits in regulating digestion rate and as an anti-cancerous medication; however, the exact mechanism has not been investigated in depth. In the present study, five pectins, two commercially available (LM and HM pectin) and three modified pectins (hydrolyzed for up to 3 h) using pectin methylesterases enzyme have been used. We study their effect on enzyme activity and in vitro starch digestion. The results indicated an inhibitory effect of pectin on α-amylase. However, there was a contradicting result when conducting in vitro digestion using α-amylase and amyloglucosidase. In addition, the results indicated that different pectin have different degree of inhibition. Further research is needed to understand this enzyme inhibitory effect.\\n\\nI believe SEM would help in identifying the mode of action of alpha amylase activity'},\n",

Clem Jones Centre for Ageing Dementia Research, Queensland Brain Institute, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. 2. Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.\\nNeurotransmitters are packaged inside synaptic vesicles that are located at the presynaptic nerve terminals. In response to an action potential, synaptic vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane (exocytosis), releasing neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. Following exocytosis, these vesicle membranes are retrieved through endocytosis and refilled with neurotransmitters for subsequent release. This recycling process is crucial to replenish the finite number of vesicles available in order to maintain synaptic transmission. The Protein Interacting with C-Kinase 1 (PICK1) is a lipid-binding protein that plays an important role in regulating the vesicular trafficking of postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptors and transporters. However, PICK1 is also expressed in the presynaptic terminals where its function is unknown. In this study, we manipulated the expression of PICK1 proteins in primary hippocampal neurons and assessed the efficiency of synaptic vesicle recycling using live-cell imaging technique to monitor the trafficking of a resident synaptic vesicle protein, synaptophysin, that is tagged with a pH-sensitive green fluorescent protein (pHluorin) in the luminal domain. We found that shRNA-mediated knockdown of PICK1 altered the kinetics of synaptic vesicle exocytosis and recycling. In addition, loss of PICK1 function leads to an increased stranding and mislocalisation of synaptophysin on the plasma membrane. Taken together, our data reveals a role for PICK1 as a novel regulator of presynaptic vesicle recycling in mammalian central neurons.\\n\\n\\nI would like to compare the number of synaptic vesicles present between experimental groups. If possible, I would also like to detect the different pools of synaptic vesicles, ie reserve pool, resting pool and the readily reserve pool or docked vesicles.'},\n",

       "  'Descr': 'Several factors are contributing to the decline of the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus), a wild arboreal herbivorous marsupial, currently experiencing dramatic declines across its free-living populations in Australia (McAlpine et al., 2015). Infection with the obligate intracellular bacteria Chlamydia pecorum is one of the major contributing factors to this decline, causing severe ocular and urogenital tract disease. Acute and/or persistent exposure to the pathogen can result in blindness, cystitis and infertility. Although histological studies have provided insight in the inflammatory processes affecting the female genital tract, describing the cystic lesions of the ovarian bursa as a sequela of previous inflammation and fibrotic reactions, understanding the ovarian function in affected animals has been limited. A major contributor to the poor outcomes for female koalas with ovarian bursal cysts is the fact that many animals are euthanised shortly after diagnosis of chlamydial infection. As there is currently no grading system for koala ovarian function that correlates histological findings to fertility, it means that it is difficult to accurately determine an individual koala’s prognosis or breeding potential. The same scenario applies to the male where a poor understanding of the pathogenesis of chlamydiosis has made difficult to understand the route of testicular infection as haematogenous or ascending, and whether the presence of Chlamydia infection has any impact on semen quality. While C. pecorum is well known to cause urethritis and prostatitis in the male koala, only recently a chronic-active granulomatous inflammation of the testis and epididymis due to this bacterium been described.\\n\\nFurthermore, our understanding of the koala immune response to infectious diseases is limited, mainly because of a lack of species-specific immune reagents. Thanks to the development of immune reagents and advances in the genomic field, several studies have underlined the ability of the koala in producing a strong and long-lasting humoral and cell-mediated immune response against the Chlamydial antigens. While little is still known about the immune response to the disease, studies on humans infected by Chlamydia trachomatis have highlighted that cytokines responses at the mucosal surfaces are leading to a strong T-cell response to the infection.\\n\\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the distribution of Chlamydia and associated pathological changes in the upper and lower genital tract of female koalas through gross examination, histopathology, immunohistochemistry (IHC), TEM and quantitative PCR.\\n\\nAIM : \\n\\nmicrotome, TEM microscope. My main is being able to localise Chlamydial bodies within the ovarian tissue collected from diseased koalas. Moreover we would like to better define the morphology of the ovarian bursa in the non-diseased koala.'},\n",

       "  'Descr': 'Structural studies of membrane proteins such as ion channels and receptors are notoriously difficult due the quantity of protein required and removal of the protein from its native and stable membrane environment using the standard approaches in the field. Frog/toad oocytes have been successfully used for the functional expression of many membrane proteins and have several innate advantages over mammalian, bacterial and insect cell expression systems for this application. Oocytes provide a relatively blank membrane background (they have very low levels of endogenous membrane proteins), they can express very high levels of membrane proteins (high density), they are very cheap to culture and the expression level (hence channel density) and presence or absence of interaction partners is easily controlled by changing the amount of RNA injected. In this project, we aim to simplify the process of gaining structural information on ion channels by exploiting the simplicity and clean background afforded by heterologous expression in frog/toad oocytes. This approach could negate the need to produce high levels of protein followed by protein purification from the membrane by isolating and mounting the plasma membrane of oocytes overexpressing specific ion channels in their native environment.\\n\\nThe aim of this project is to develop a new method to obtain stable, high density membrane proteins for structural studies. As a pilot, we would like to obtain a high resolution tomography of high-pressure frozen membranes containing a homogeneous population of a model ion channel with a large extracellular domain in comparison to empty membrane. If possible, we would like to then use cryo-EM to obtain higher resolution images of the channel and assess the applicability of this approach to other types of ion channels/receptors.'},\n",

Using light as an external trigger provides selectivity and reaction control for applications in various fields, for instance, imaging, catalysis and drug delivery. Photochemical activation with visible light is of particular interest for generating on-demand reactivity. The major challenge in the context of biological applications is the required wavelength regime, since high energy UV-light has been reported to introduce photo damage to molecules, biological substances or tissues. We developed a new bioorthogonal reaction which can be triggered by visible-light in absence of a catalyst. To provide the biocompatibility, the system is water-soluble and the excitation wavelength of the systems is above 380 nm.

The most currently available commercial vaccines are based on soluble proteins. However, particulate antigen formulations showed superior immunological properties compared to their soluble counterparts and are increasingly considered in vaccine formulations because they mimic the size of the pathogen and enhance immunogenicity through effective uptake by the antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and prolonged antigen presentation. This study uses PHA beads and novel protein particles as carrier systems for vaccine development against bacterial pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus suis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. Selected antigens were incorporated into the protein coat of PHA beads and particles using synthetic biology. The bacterial biopolyester synthase mediates the assembly of spherical inclusions.

Classical vaccine strategies may not be the best suited for combating an emerging pandemic. Novel vaccine methods are being studied to develop vaccines that can be easily adapted, scaled up and FDA approved in a short period of time. One of these novel methods relies on particulate-based vaccines. Essentially particulate-based vaccines are microscopical beads carrying parts of a pathogen, such as proteins or polysaccharides. For our particulate vaccines, we are using polyhydroxy butyrate (PHB) polyester bead that is naturally produced by several bacteria when they are grown under carbon-rich conditions. These beads are biodegradable, non-toxic, non-immunogenic, and allow for protein expression on the surface of the beads. The aim of the project is to produce PHB bead particulate vaccine displaying antigens, that are specific to a particular disease and evaluate their immunogenicity.\\n\\nAIM: TEM images will be taken to observe the accumulation and size analyses of PHB bead in whole cells and purified BP fractions.\\nIn addition, to observe how the bone marrow derived dendritic cells phagocytoses PHB beads that are expressing the antigens on the surface and processing and presenting on the surface. \\nSEM requested 19.1.23 (Eunice).\\n'},\n",

Disrupted Ca2+ uptake causes various physiological disorders such as tomato blossom-end rot (BER), apple bitter pit and pear hard end. Unlike other macro elements such as nitrogen and potassium, Ca2+ is relatively immobile in plants phloem/symplast system. Ca2+ translocation efficiency is influenced by tissues cellular partitioning, supply between symplastic and apoplastic spaces and allocation across various cell compartments. Under abiotic conditions like salinity, this efficiency is further restricted, particularly to fruit distal parts. This study, therefore, aimed to map Ca2+ spatial distribution pattern and translocation in ‘Roma’ tomato flesh as affected by NaCl through proximal, middle and distal tissues using synchrotron based μ-XFM.\\n\\nAIM: The central objective of this study was to compare Ca2+ mobility routes, distribution and transit spots with and without NaCl in water regimes. This will involve multiscale spatial distribution and translocation of the Ca2+ ions in flesh with contrasting mesocarp tissues; proximal, middle and distal. Also, this study attempted to overcome the difficulties of assessing specific uptake pathways and storage mechanisms that influence Ca2+ deficiency and physiological disorders like blossom end rot. Moreover, this work correlated flesh Ca2+/Na+ concentration obtained by ICP and information obtained from synchrotron based μ-XFM.'},\n",

       "  'Descr': 'Natural killer (NK) cells and innate lymphocyte cells (ILC1) belong to the Group 1 ILC family. These cells are important contributors of inflammatory events by secretion of myeloid-activating cytokines such as interferon-\\uf067 (IFN-\\uf067) or GM-CSF, and for cancer and viral control by mediating cytotoxicity of altered cells. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized cancer immunotherapy by reactivating cytotoxic lymphocytes. Conventional checkpoint inhibitors primarily block inhibitory pathways in tumour-infiltrating T cells. However, interest in other effector populations, such as NK cells is growing. NK cells possess an innate ability to detect cellular transformation and are key to cancer immunosurveillance, particularly in settings of metastasis or haematological cancers without the need of prior sensitization and a reduced risk of autoimmune disease. At the same time, cancer cells utilize a number of mechanisms to evade immunosurveillance by NK cells, such by production of different molecules that impair NK cells functions. One specific type of molecules present on the tumour microenvironment (TME) is the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β superfamily. TGF-β have 3 isoforms (TGF-β1, 2 and 3) which are recognized by a heterodimeric transmembrane receptor formed by TGF-βRI and TGF-βRII). TGF-β signalling is an important suppressor of NK cell proliferation, metabolism, cytotoxicity, cytokine production and anti-metastatic functions in experimental tumour models. Our research group identified the TGF-β as suppressor of IL-15-induced metabolism in NK cells, resulting in loss of effector anti-tumour effector functions, and increase of tissue resident biomarkers such as CD49a, DNAM-1 and TRAIL.\\n\\nAIM: In this project we are going to incubate mouse NK cells wit TGF-B and we want to observe the effects on the cell organelles (mitochondria, ribosomes and lysosomes).\\nWe expect the see alterations on the shape of mitochondrias and reduction of ribosomes and lysosomes, after exposure to TGF-B.\\n\\nWe would like to use the Hitachi HT 7700 and FEI Scios FIB - Dual Beam SEM microscopes.\\n'},\n",

However, the conditions used to coat metals are currently too harsh for most polymeric substrates.

As the grafted coating is nanometre thick specialist surface analysis techniques are needed for comprehensive analysis.

       "  'Descr': 'Despite being curable, tuberculosis (TB) still represent a major health threat worldwide. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the pathogen responsible for TB, primarily infects the lungs, but it can spread and infect other organs. This condition is known as disseminated TB, and it represents a more serious form of the disease.\\nSeveral pathogens bind plasminogen (Plg), a human glycoprotein, component of the fibrinolytic system, and exploit plasmin (Plg activated form) activity to degrade extracellular matrix and enhance their dissemination. We hypothesise that Mtb uses this same mechanism and identified Antigen (Ag) 85B as a Plg binding ligand. Ag85B is one of the most abundant Mtb secreted proteins and it is known for its ability to bind fibronectin. We demonstrated the interaction between Ag85B and Plg via native ligand blot and Biolayer Interferometry experiments. We are now aiming to confirm that Ag85B and Plg (and fibronectin) are forming a complex, via mass photometry experiments.\\n\\nAIM: We aim to use the Refeyn mass photometry system to detect the formation of Ag85B-Plg complexes. We would also like to investigate whether these proteins form complexes with fibronectin too.\\n'},\n",

Poly[ADP-ribose] Polymerase 1 has been proposed to be involved in a wide variety of DNA repair pathways involved in maintaining genome stability. Banf1 was identified by our team to be an effective regulator of PARP1 in that it inhibits PARP1 activity by directly binding to it in the proximity of its nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) binding pocket.

The cellulose nanocrystals formation involves different pre-treatments including washing, drying, grinding and size reduction of biomass, followed by dewaxing, delignification, bleaching and hydrolysis processing. The hydrolysis can further be divided into acid hydrolysis, mineral acid hydrolysis, organic acid hydrolysis, solid acid hydrolysis, enzymatic hydrolysis and ionic liquid hydrolysis. The cellulose based materials possess significant characteristics including chemical properties, thermal properties, structural properties, and rheological properties which shows the importance of cellulose based materials for numerous applications including electronics, cosmetics, water sorption, wastewater treatment via absorption, packaging materials, biomedicine and soil remediation.\\n\\nAIM: SEM, TEM, XRD and AFM'},\n",

A total of 60 muscle samples will be collected for the project.\\n\\nAim is to estimate the glycogen volume fraction in each myofiber compartment (subsarcolemmal, intermyofibrillar, and intramyofibrillar) using transmission electron microscopy, specifically, using the transmission electron microscope, JEOL JEM-1011 at UQ. This will require tissue samples to undergo the following steps: post-fixation, embedding, sectioning, and imaging. Please refer to the methods below that have been provided by Associate Professor Joachim Nielsen (University of Southern Denmark), a collaborator on this project, and will provide ongoing assistance:\\n\\n1.0 Post-fixation\\n\\n1.1 Postfix with 1% osmium tetroxide (OsO4) and 1.5% potassium ferrocyanide (K4Fe(CN)6) in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer for 120 min at 4oC. Note: The use of 1.5% potassium ferrocyanide (K4Fe(CN)6) is essential for an optimal contrast of glycogen particles 8-10.\\n\\n1.2. Rinse twice in double-distilled water at room temperature (RT).\\n\\n1.3. Dehydrate through a graded series of alcohol at RT.\\n\\nNote: The protocol can be paused here.\\n\\n2.0 Embedding\\n\\nInfiltrate with graded mixtures of propylene oxide and Epon at RT. Embed in 100% Epon at 60oC for 48h.\\n\\n3.0 Sectioning\\n\\n3.1 Cut ultra-thin (60 nm) sections of longitudinal oriented fibers (Ultra-microtome Leica UC7, Leica, Wienna, Austria) and collect them on cobber grids.\\n\\n3.2. Contrast sections with uranyl acetate and lead citrate.\\n\\nNote: The protocol can be paused here.\\n\\n4. Imaging\\n\\n4.1. Turn on the microscope, computer, and imaging software (Philips CM 100 Transmission EM (Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands), operated at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. Digital images are recorded with an OSIS Veleta digital slow scan 2k x 2k CCD camera and the ITEM software package).\\n\\n4.2. Place the grid with multiple sections in the microscope stage.\\n\\n4.3. Find fields of view, which contain multiple longitudinally oriented fibers.\\n\\n4.4. Acquire a total of 24 images of a randomly selected fiber including 12 images of the myofibrillar space and 12 images of the subsarcolemmal space at a magnification between 10 and 40 kx. The images should be distributed across the length and width of the fiber in a randomised, but systematic order to obtain unbiased results.\\n\\nNote: The optimal magnification depends on the available camera resolution and the size of the micrographs. The goal is to achive a final resolution, where glycogen particle diameters can be measured within 1 nm steps, and to include a total area of the myofibrillar region of at least 70 μm2 and a total length of the fiber of at least 25 μm distributed on 12 images of the myofibrillar space and 12 images of the subsarcolemmal space per fiber, respectively. The 24 number of images per fiber will most likely give a precision (coefficent of error) of the volumetric content of the different pools of glycogen between 0.1 and 0.2 in individual fibers from both human, rat and mice skeletal muscles.\\n\\n4.5. Repeat 2.4 until a total of 6-10 fibers are imaged. If needed, cut additional sections (separated by at least 150 μm to avoid overlap of already images fibres) and repeat step 3.1-4.5.'},\n",

The caveat of decreasing the laser spot size is less material is ionized and diminishing ion yields. Post-ionization methods such as plasma or MALDI-2 provide an avenue to increase ion yield without sacrificing image spatial resolution, however, the mechanisms of ionization are yet to be elucidated. For molecules with multiple ionization sites, the mechanisms of ion formation (specifically, protonation) are further complicated by competition between protonation sites. The aim for this project is to understand how protonation occurs for an archetype class of fluoroquinolone antibiotics using MALDI-based ionization sources. This experimental evidence will form part of a framework to determine the fundamental drivers of protonation isomer formation.\\n\\nAIM: From previous data taken on our Bruker TIMS-TOF Pro in Wollongong, we showed that plasma-based post-ionization methods afforded multiple protonation site isomers for ten common fluoroquinolone antibiotics, and the relative ratios of protonation isomers could be controlled by solvent vapour doping and changing the matrix composition. Using the TIMS-TOF Flex under reduced pressure conditions, we want to acquire comparison data showing the formation of protonation isomers–or not—during conventional MALDI-based ionization.

The guest is the emitter molecule that when two opposite charges combine on this molecule a specific colour of light is emitted.

Antifouling surfaces capable of reducing the non-specific binding of proteins, cells, and microorganisms are important to a variety of biomedical applications. Antifouling polymers have been found to be available as coatings for macroscopic surfaces (such as implants and biosensors) and nanoparticle systems, endowing them with the ability to reduce biofouling and evade the body[[sqote]]s immune clearance mechanisms. Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) has been the gold standard polymer applied on antifouling surfaces for a long time. However, recent evidence has revealed the limitations of PEG including particularly its immunogenicity. The limitations of PEG have compromised its function and driven further development of advanced surface coatings and nanoparticle designs modified with alternative anti-biofouling polymers.\\nThis PhD project will focus on the development of an emerging class of anti-fouling sulfoxide polymers and their derivatives to modulate the interaction between biological systems and material surfaces. First of all, the relationship between the structure of the polymer grafted surfaces and their corresponding antifouling performance will be investigated. Then, further applications in antifouling and/or antibacterial medical devices and nano-delivery systems will be attempted. The project will eventually contribute to the development of ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) catheters with excellent antifouling properties and advanced nanoparticles as drug carriers with prolonged circulation and improved delivery efficiency.\\n\\nAIM: Chemical elements and deconvolution analysis by XPS,surfaxce morphlogy observation by SEM\\n'},\n",
